The results forced Tsai to quit as DPP leader as the Beijing-friendly main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) made gains in the face of China\u2019s increasing pressure on the island.The DPP has now been left in control of only six of Taiwan\u2019s cities and counties, compared with at least 15 for the KMT. The losses included one of its most steadfast strongholds, the southern city of Kaohsiung. \u201cThe (election) results reflected the strong will of the Taiwan public in hoping to continue to share the benefits of the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, and their strong wish in hoping to improve the island\u2019s economy and people\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d said a statement by China\u2019s policy-making  Affairs Office and carried by state media.As well as voting for seats from village to city level, there were 10 referendums on the ballot, including pro- and anti-gay marriage proposals.A referendum calling for marriage to only be recognised as between a man and a woman in Taiwan\u2019s civil code won more than 7m votes, while another calling for same-sex unions to be regulated under a separate law gained more than 6m.Gay rights activists had proposed that the civil code should give same-sex couples equal marriage rights, but only garnered 3m votes.The Coalition for the Happiness of our Next Generation said the win was a \u201cvictory of all people who treasure family values\u201d.Jennifer Lu, a spokeswoman for Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, said they were saddened by what she described as the \u201cabsurd referendums\u201d and blamed government \u201cincompetence\u201d for allowing the anti-gay marriage votes to go ahead.Taiwan\u2019s top court legalised same-sex marriage in May 2017, the first place in Asia to do so, and ruled that it must be brought in within two years, but the government has made little progress in the face of opposition from conservative groups.Although the government has clearly stated that the referendum results will not impact the court\u2019s original decision to legalise gay marriage, LGBT campaigners worry that their newly won rights will be weakened.With the conservative vote passing the threshold of 25% of eligible electors, under referendum law the government must take steps to reflect the result.Tsai and the DPP have faced a mounting backlash over domestic reforms as well as concerns about deteriorating ties with China, which still sees self-ruling Taiwan as part of its territory to be reunified.Tsai told reporters that she would take \u201ccomplete responsibility\u201d for the defeat as she resigned as chair of the party.Beijing has intensified pressure on Taiwan under Tsai, upping military drills, poaching diplomatic allies and successfully convincing international businesses to list the island as part of China on their websites.The DPP is traditionally pro-independence and Tsai has refused to acknowledge Beijing\u2019s stance that Taiwan is part of \u201cone China\u201d, unlike her KMT predecessor Ma Ying-jeou.Ahead of the vote, Tsai and DPP officials repeatedly accused China of meddling in the lead-up to the elections by operating a \u201cfake news\u201d campaign. Beijing has denied the allegations."},

The first one had been opened earlier and examined by officials, but Saturday\u2019s unveiling was the first time authorities had opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media.One of the two contained the \u201cwell-preserved\u201d mummified remains of a woman named Thuya, the antiquities ministry said in a statement, but ministry spokeswoman Nevine Aref later said work was continuing to definitively identify the name of the mummy.\u201cOne sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the 17th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the 18th dynasty,\u201d the minister of antiquities, Khaled al-Anani, said. \u201cThe two tombs were present with their mummies inside.\u201dThe 18th dynasty dates back to the 13th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well-known pharaohs, including Tutankhamun and Ramses II.Located between the royal tombs at the Valley of the Queens and the Valley of the Kings, the Al-Assasif necropolis is the burial site of nobles and senior officials close to the pharaohs.Among the finds in the tomb were sarcophagi, statues and some 1,000 funerary figurines called ushabtis, made of wood, faience and clay.The tomb belonged to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the mummification supervisor at the Temple of Mut in Karnak, according to the ministry. The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle kingdom \u2013 almost 4,000 years ago \u2013 but was reused during the late period.Rubble 300m deep was removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling with paintings depicting the owner and his family. has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year.

The Mate 20 Pro packs more cutting-edge technology into it than any other, but unlike most bleeding-edge devices it makes for a great experience.It looks like an iPhone XS mated with a  Galaxy Note 9, with a huge curved 6.39in OLED display and big notch in the top. The screen is great and hides a good pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner. The curved sides and narrow width makes the massive screen manageable. The top notch hides the 3D face recognition system that uses the same technology as Apple\u2019s Face ID.If that wasn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that gives you up to 5x hybrid zoom and all the way down to 0.6x for wide-angle photos, which make instant panoramas. The front-facing selfie camera isn\u2019t bad either.Performance is top-notch, while battery life is near double the competition. There\u2019s wireless charging in the back, which can even wirelessly charge other devices at the flick of a switch. The 40W cable charger is superfast, too. isn\u2019t the best Android experience available, but it\u2019s much improved on older versions. The glass back can even have a vinyl-like texture to it, which makes it less slippery and repels fingerprints. The best phone of the year isn\u2019t cheap, but offers a brilliant, cutting-edge experience that lasts ages between charges.\u00a3899The oldest phone here, released a month before the rest, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 9 is a different beast.It\u2019s got a stunning 6.4in OLED screen, a top-of-the-line processor, expandable storage, a great dual camera on the back, wireless charging and even a headphone jack \u2013 the only phone here to do so.But it is the stylus that pops out from a port in the bottom of the phone that sets it apart. It might be tiny, but it\u2019s one of the best you can buy on any device. Draw, sign, annotate, poke, prod and even click the camera shutter with the new remote Bluetooth button option, to your heart\u2019s content. When you\u2019re done, you can just slot it in the bottom and forget about it. The stylus charges in seconds once docked and lasts about 30 minutes of continuous use.For now, the Note 9 only runs the older Android 8.1 version, not the latest  like the rest. But the Note 9 is still the do-anything phone, if you can put up with its massive size. For those that need a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it.\u00a3999Apple\u2019s iPhone XS is arguably the best smaller phone on the market. Its 5.8in OLED screen is brilliant, while the all-screen design is space efficient, meaning it has a big screen squeezed into a small body.It also has a superfast processor, snappy performance and the excellent  facial recognition system. The home button has been replaced with Apple\u2019s best-in-class , which takes about 10 minutes to adjust to.The dual-camera system on the back is great, too, offering some of the best detailed photos, zoom and low-light performance. Apple\u2019s excellent Portrait mode is fun, as are the face-tracking .Battery life is only OK, managing to get through most days, but you\u2019ll need to charge it before heading out for a night on the town. Wireless charging in the back makes that easy, but the included cable charger is pretty slow.It\u2019s also super expensive, but it has a luxurious feel that\u2019s unrivalled in 2018, and it\u2019s heavier than you might expect, so at least it feels like you\u2019re getting \u00a31,000 worth of phone. Most users will stick it in a case because the glass front and back will smash if dropped. Pricey, but the best iPhone available and a brilliant combination of size and capability.\u00a3499The OnePlus 6T proves you don\u2019t need \u00a3900-plus to buy cutting-edge technology.Building on the excellent , the 6T has a great in-display fingerprint sensor and a tiny, widow\u2019s-peak-like notch for the selfie camera. For \u00a3500 you get top\u2011of-the-line specs, plenty of storage, dual-sim support and a brilliant screen. You also get a good, but not quite the best, dual-camera system on the back, a good selfie camera on the front and good battery life.The OnePlus 6T is a brutally fast device with an Android experience that\u2019s second only to Google\u2019s Pixel 3. Gaming performance is solid, too, while there are plenty of customisation options, including a solid set of gestures for navigation that rival Apple\u2019s.Despite having a glass back, there\u2019s no wireless charging, but the cable charger is really fast. The  switching between silent, vibrate and ring is a nice touch. It may not have the best camera, but you have to spend nearly double to get a better phone than this.\u00a3739The Pixel 3 is arguably the best Android device with a comparatively small 5.5in screen. But unlike most smaller phones, it isn\u2019t a cheaper, cutdown version of something larger.You get a top-of-the-line processor, a cracking single-camera system that\u2019s better than most dual cameras and a bright, crisp OLED screen. You also get the best of , including Gmail\u2019s autocomplete for blasting through mundane emails, lots of useful local AI tools, and three years of software updates.The Pixel 3 has an all-glass design, although not exactly all-screen, stereo speakers and even a dual-camera system on the front for shooting wide-angle selfies. Battery is only OK, but the two-tone glass back has wireless charging.But it is the ultra-refined experience that is the big draw, which offers an Apple-level of polish, raising the bar for Android. The best Android experience you can buy in 2018, but not necessarily the best smartphone."},

His stepmother described him as a respectful young man and said he was the son of a Birmingham police officer.Police initially said an officer shot Bradford because he was seen \u201cbrandishing a handgun\u201d while fleeing the scene.In a Friday news release, police captain Gregg Rector said new evidence suggested that while Bradford \u201cmay have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim\u201d.Rector said police now believed more than two individuals were involved in the altercation that started the shooting and a gunman was at large.Bradford\u2019s father, Emantic Bradford Sr, said on Saturday night that his son had a permit to carry a weapon for self-defense."},

I was disconcerted, though. The sense of relief that people talk about didn\u2019t come. You just stood there. Staring.So I explained that I\u2019d been forcibly intoxicated. It was when I went to visit him at university. I\u2019d been drinking, but when we got back, I\u2019d sobered up considerably, until he reached for the bottle. I remembered the strangest details, like the colour of the tabletop it happened on, how it was tacky beneath my hands \u2013 he never was one for cleaning. I told you about the whole relationship, how he beat me and excused it as \u201ckinky sex\u201d. Still you stood there. I think you hugged me. We went to bed. I woke up and went to work. The usual mundane routine resumed. I felt as numb as ever.Then we were in the kitchen. You asked \u2013 anguished \u2013 why I had kept seeing him, why I didn\u2019t just leave. You asked why I drank when I know what happens to girls who drink, whose inhibitions are lowered. Only it wasn\u2019t anguish for me. It was anguish for yourself.

Profound questions of mortality were keeping him awake at night. \u201cI had started to think, \u2018Who will remember me when I\u2019m gone? Who will talk about me? Who will be my heir?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI think our biggest fear in life is not to die, but to be forgotten.\u201dSo Louis made an audacious plan. If he wasn\u2019t going to have children of his own in the normal way, maybe he could donate sperm in such quantity that \u2013 eventually \u2013 a child might try to find him. To pull it off, Louis would need to play a biological numbers game. \u201cIf I had 10 children this way, there would be a very slim chance of success,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what if I had 100\u2026 or even more?\u201d***Talking publicly for the first time via a video call, Louis, now 68, wears a denim shirt and occasionally waves his arms at the screen, which is propped up on a pile of books. \u201cLouis\u201d is an alias he has asked to use because, among the other consequences of his actions, he has been threatened. Speaking deliberately, with the fluency of a man who has had a lot of explaining to do, he describes how his mission has transformed hundreds of lives, but also raised questions about family secrecy, identity and the ethics of artificial insemination.Louis was born in the Netherlands but spent his earliest years in Suriname in South America, where his father, a doctor, was born. Louis barely saw him and he and his mother, a Dutch missionary nurse, returned to Holland when Louis was six. His father later also settled there.Louis and his father were largely estranged, but the boy felt a pressure to seize opportunities his Surinamese family never had in the former Dutch colony. Even so, he struggled at school and dropped out of university. \u201cWhen I was 21, I got a job at the bank and I sat behind a typewriter, which then became a computer, for 39 years,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy father was never able to understand that. He felt like he had given me a chance and I hadn\u2019t taken it.\u201dA broken home turned Louis against the idea of marriage. Had his parents been happy, he wonders if he might now have siblings and closer ties to his extended family. Perhaps he would have a family of his own. He also believes he has a form of autism, which has made relationships and emotions difficult. He says he doesn\u2019t feel things like other people. Romances have died on the vine. He was happy in his own company, but an existential angst still consumed him \u2013 until he decided on his unique mission.I was pregnant with twins when I found I had 15 siblings and that my father was not my fatherRegulation of Dutch sperm banks was lax in the early 80s, but Louis knew that donating at the level he needed would be discouraged. (Laws still vary. In Britain today, the same donor sperm may be used in no more than 10 families. In Holland, the limit is now 25. Any more, and the risk of accidental incest is thought too great.) To avoid raising suspicion, Louis used three sperm banks, the farthest one a short train ride away, logging his donations in a notebook he still keeps on a shelf.For 20 years, from 1982, Louis donated as often as three times a week, generally before work. He says the banks must have known he was visiting too often, but demand for reliable donors was high: Louis was an asset. The clinic he cycled to, it would later transpire, had also exaggerated his credentials in the anonymous profile for prospective mothers. \u201cIt said I was university-educated, that I was a boss at a bank and that I had no interest in being contacted by future children,\u201d he says. It also failed to mention his ethnicity; Louis describes his father as \u201cblack and white \u2013 we descend from African slaves and their owners\u201d.While the sperm banks turned a blind eye, Louis never lost sight of his goal. He describes it as a train that was hard to stop. Eventually, in 2002, he felt as if he had done enough. By then, Louis was in his 50s and his oldest children \u2013 wherever they were \u2013 would be adults. He returned to his quiet life and waited.***As she grew up, Joyce Curiere, now 34, became aware that she did not look much like her blond, blue-eyed father. She has freckles and thick brown, curly hair. \u201cMy parents would say things like, \u2018Well, you look just like your grandad\u2019s grandad,\u2019\u201d says the former nurse, who now works in sales in Amsterdam. When a grandparent let slip the truth \u2013 that her parents used donor sperm \u2013 Joyce, then 16, confronted them. They refused to admit it. She wanted to know more, but had no idea where to begin.In Britain,  have the right to find out the identity of their biological parents when they reach 18; Holland has introduced a similar law. Children born before 2005 do not get the same right to know, but what has changed for them is the rise of consumer DNA testing. Services such as  and  offer low-cost reports in weeks, including genetic matches to other people who have submitted samples to their growing databases. In Holland, several family reunion TV shows have emerged in this era of genetic accessibility. In 2015, 14 years after she confronted her parents, Joyce sat down one night to watch Familie Gezocht (Family Search). It featured a woman called Amanda.\u201cShe was a nurse, too, and had curly, brown hair and the same voice as me,\u201d Joyce says. \u201cThey showed pictures of her as a baby and I was like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s me. Those are my pictures.\u2019\u201d Amanda even wore similar earrings, and had a tattoo on the same shoulder. Two weeks later, Joyce sent off a DNA sample to a Dutch foundation that helps unite donor families. \u201cI was pregnant with twins when I found I had 15 siblings and that my father was not my father,\u201d she says.Those 15 people had already started their searches, and submitted samples. So had Louis. The children matched each other \u2013 and him \u2013 and the number quickly grew. Louis has calculated his donations have resulted in 200 births, \u201cgive or take a dozen\u201d. He doubts another estimate, which he says came from the foundation, that he may have as many as 1,000 children. Confidentiality and use of unlicensed donors means records are hard to keep, but a figure anywhere near this high would make Louis one of the world\u2019s most prolific fathers.For Joyce, the revelation was overwhelming. Yet her parents refused to accept the DNA evidence. \u201cTheir doctor said never to tell their child she\u2019s from a donor because it would get them in trouble,\u201d Joyce says. She is now estranged from them. After a difficult pregnancy, followed by postnatal depression, she did not have the time or emotional strength to meet her biological father. Not yet.***Four years before Joyce\u2019s discovery, Louis happened to see a TV show called Wie Is Mijn Vader? (Who Is My Father?). \u201cThey had a couple of twins and a sister, and at first I didn\u2019t react,\u201d he says. \u201cThen they said the names of the boys who wanted to meet their father. They were Maaike and Matthijs. I thought, \u2018Shit, those two are mine! It is really happening.\u2019\u201dThese names had meant something to Louis since the autumn of 1989, when he had spotted a document he should not have seen at one of the sperm banks. It had the names of two children \u2013 Maaike and Matthijs \u2013 and some basic information about their donor: dark hair, dark eyes, A+ blood type. \u201cI thought, that\u2019s me, those must be my children,\u201d Louis says. He made a note of the names. \u201cI call it divine intervention that made me look at the right place at the right time,\u201d he adds. \u201cJust as it was in 2011, when I watched that TV programme.\u201dIvo worries about his children having romantic meetings with relatives. \u2018What if they party in the same city centre?\u2019On the show, the twins talked about hoping to meet their father one day. \u201cI looked more closely, and they looked like me,\u201d Louis says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel feelings, but I can say that this was like an explosion.\u201d He contacted the TV company, and submitted a DNA sample. He got a call to say eight children were, at that stage, looking for the same father. The first meeting came later in 2011, when Louis arranged, through the foundation, to see a brother and sister. \u201cThere was no crying, but they did find it very intense,\u201d Louis says. \u201cIt was difficult, because I thought they would want to know everything about me, so I gave them everything, and it was a lot. I had to learn to listen. But they were mine. They really existed.\u201dIn the seven years since, Louis has met more than 40 of the 57 children to whom he has now been matched. Joyce emails me a list of their dates of birth and initials. Joyce is among the oldest, and was born in March 1984. The frequency of the dates suggests a village school, rather than a family. Children known as I, B, M, K, H and G were also born in 1984. H and J arrive in 1985, and six more in 1986.A few months after her own twins were born, Joyce decided to meet up with Louis. She remembers being struck by how alike they looked. Louis talked and talked. \u201cAll the things I had wanted to know about myself \u2013 all the answers I had been searching for since I was 16 \u2013 he gave me in 90 minutes,\u201d she says, sitting next to Louis (he has travelled to her home for the interview). He had a dark sense of humour she immediately recognised as her own: \u201cSometimes I still sit with a cup of tea and ask, \u2018How did this happen?\u2019\u201d she says.She also got to meet Amanda, the sister with the same tattoo she\u2019d seen on TV. All the siblings describe an instant, reassuring recognition when they first met \u2013 an immediate ease; a shared sense of humour. This is captured in  from a documentary they contributed to in 2015. When Joyce answers her door to Amanda, they are wearing very similar floral dresses. They have the same stature, hair, eyes. They head to the park and toast each other with a glass of wine. \u201cTo being sisters and finding each other because the universe wants it that way,\u201d Joyce says. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d***With each documentary and news report about Louis\u2019 children, awareness of his story has grown. So have the Facebook and WhatsApp groups the siblings use to communicate. The web got more tangled still when one mother was angered to learn her donor was mixed race. She talked to a Belgian newspaper and, Joyce says, a neo-Nazi group threatened to \u201ccome for Louis\u201d. Some siblings were against even an anonymous interview, partly out of concern for his safety: \u201cBut I think he should tell his story now,\u201d Joyce says, \u201cand not just be talked about.\u201dLouis is matter-of-fact about the ethics of his endeavour. He feels no remorse, but for some the experience has been fraught. Each child arrives with their own story \u2013 and questions. Ivo van Halen, 34, learned only recently that his parents had been preparing to tell him the truth about his parentage, until his mother died in a car crash. Ivo was 11, and his father lost the courage; he couldn\u2019t risk losing his sons. They had his hair colour and never suspected he was not their father (Ivo\u2019s brother is from another donor). But five years ago, Ivo\u2019s father called his sons together and told them. \u201cWe said it changed nothing,\u201d says Ivo, who works in IT. \u201cI felt sad for him, that he\u2019d had so much difficulty with it.\u201dIvo felt little need to find his biological father until he, too, saw a documentary featuring some of Louis\u2019 children. The story had now become part of a bigger scandal in Holland, after it was revealed that the doctor who ran one sperm bank Louis used had secretly donated his own sperm, and mixed it with other donations to increase the chances of conception (the doctor has since died). Watching it, Ivo says, \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, these people even move like me. OK, now I want to know.\u2019\u201d He did a DNA test, and joined the Facebook group.Ivo has not yet met Louis, though they have exchanged emails. He struggles to explain the delay; he appreciates knowing the truth about his identity, and has enjoyed meeting his siblings, but not for the same reasons as Louis: he has young children now, and wants to protect the next generation from the risk of romantic meetings with distant relatives. \u201cWhat if they all go and party in the same city centre?\u201d he asks. \u201cI want to prevent accidents from happening.\u201d\u201cThere are bigger threats in this world,\u201d Louis says in an email when I press him on these risks. \u201cBut if Ivo\u2019s concerns bring new sheep to the flock, who am I to protest?\u201d There is some ego in his mission. He is only half joking, during the video call, when he reaches to ancient Egypt for a metaphor. \u201cThe pharaohs built pyramids,\u201d he says. \u201cThese children are my pyramids.\u201dLouis, whose own parents died in 1988 and 1990, is close to only a handful of the children he has discovered so far. On the day I talk to Ivo, the group of siblings receives a message from Jordy Willekens, who is 28 and has been a member for three years. He has news to share: he has decided to make Louis his legal father. Jordy always knew he had a father out there, because he grew up with two mothers. He thinks their honesty partly explains why he felt little need to find his father. He also assumed it would be too much effort. \u201cIf I had realised it would be this easy, I would have done it 10 years ago,\u201d he says.Three years ago, Jordy\u2019s then girlfriend alerted him to a documentary about the group of siblings. \u201cIt was madness to think I could deny it,\u201d he says of the physical likeness he saw in them. He got the test, joined the group and, in 2016, met Louis in a restaurant. \u201cHe stared at me for 10 minutes,\u201d Jordy recalls. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t awkward. It felt like I had found half of me.\u201dJordy, who also works in IT, grew fond of Louis. He gets him. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid eventually to turn up alone without anyone to love us,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to those lengths, but he never had anyone to tell him it wasn\u2019t ethical or that he wasn\u2019t alone.\u201dSix months ago, in the shower, he decided to make the legal change. The paperwork came through last week. As we talk, Jordy gets an email from Louis asking if he has shared the news with the group. \u201cHe has addressed it to \u2018My dear son\u2019,\u201d Jordy says, laughing a little.Louis says Joyce and Maaike, the other two children to whom he has grown closest, are also now in his will. He is not a rich man, but says he always hated the idea that strangers would one day come to clear out his apartment and arrange his funeral. \u201cNow I have three heirs,\u201d he says after Jordy\u2019s news breaks. \u201cPerhaps there will be others. Mission accomplished.\u201dIf Jordy now sees Louis as a father, for some it\u2019s not quite as clear. Joyce, who sees him only occasionally (they live in different cities), describes him more as a good friend she can phone for advice. She has lost contact with the father who raised her, but says she isn\u2019t looking for a replacement.Seventeen of the siblings are members of the WhatsApp group. They talk about work and share memes in the usual way. \u201cYou can discuss sperm only so much,\u201d Jordy says. \u201cBut there\u2019s always a buzz when new blood is added to the mix.\u201d Not that everyone wants to be part of this strange new family. For some, the shock of discovery is too much. \u201cWhen I met one daughter, it was as if all the energy in the room blew away,\u201d Louis says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say, she didn\u2019t know what to say, and later she told me she didn\u2019t want to meet again.\u201dJordy\u2019s biological mother, who separated from her partner years ago, had no idea who had helped her have a child, or why. She was initially concerned about her son\u2019s search, but approved once he reassured her it could never change their relationship. Last summer, she and Jordy met Louis together. \u201cI was walking behind them at one point and I was like, is this really happening?\u201d Jordy recalls. He sees Louis as a real father now \u2013 just not a straightforward one. What did his mother think of Louis? \u201cShe liked him,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said to him, \u2018We created something really nice.\u2019 And he agreed with her.\u201d Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."},
{"title": "Futurists imagine life in 2050", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/nov/25/futurists-the-world-in-2050-science-medicine-food-travel-predictions", "content": "arlier this year, the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku published a book, , in which he grappled with a question central to most of our lives: what will our future look like? Kaku is a popular scientist. He has a knack for studying today\u2019s trends in order to hypothesise what might come tomorrow \u2013 how we\u2019ll live, where we\u2019ll live, whether or not an almighty AI might soon rule over us. And he\u2019s not the only one. Futurists have been conceptualising our potential fate for centuries, sometimes successfully. Perhaps, as we stumble through uncertain times, their work is more important now than ever. So what will the world look like in 2050? We asked Kaku and three other futurists to share their predictions.By 2050 we\u2019ll be able to send memories, emotions and feelings across the internet. Brain science will have exploded, and it will have revolutionised communication. Teenagers will love it. Instead of putting an emoticon at the end of every sentence, they\u2019ll use an emotion: anger, happiness, excitement. This will replace entertainment; movies will become obsolete. I\u2019m talking about telepathy, really. We\u2019ll still communicate the old-fashioned way, but communicating telepathically will reduce the obstacles between people. Our grandchildren will wonder, What is a keyboard? We will enter the age of the \u201cbrain net\u201d.Medicine will develop exponentially, too. We will have cured certain forms of cancer, and we will have begun to treat the disease like the common cold. We\u2019ll live with it. It will no longer be lethal. We won\u2019t fear it like we used to. Technology will help in this respect. Smart toilets will perform liquid biopsies \u2013 which are already available \u2013 to detect cancer cells, genes and enzymes. We\u2019ll catch tumours years or even decades before they form, when they\u2019re just small colonies of several hundred cells circulating in the blood. Smart objects will measure our biometrics automatically. The iPhone can already calculate a pulse. In the future, our clothes will detect the beginnings of a heart attack, and advise us to seek treatment immediately.This results, naturally, in longevity. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be immortal by 2050, but we\u2019ll be setting the foundations for immortality. We\u2019re gradually discovering the genes that control the ageing process, and we\u2019ll soon understand how to repair the biological damage inflicted on our bodies over the course of our lives. In this way, medicine will move past simply providing a cure, and will help move humanity closer to biological perfection. We will become gods. We\u2019ll have the immortal body of Venus. The speed of Mercury. The power of the mind of Zeus.But what use is longevity without eternal youth? That\u2019s where the idea of a human body shop comes in. We\u2019ll grow organs to replace those that wear out. We can already use human cells to grow skin, cartilage, noses, ears, heart valves, bladders\u2026 In the future? We\u2019ll grow the liver, the kidney, perhaps the pancreas. By 2050 I suspect we\u2019ll be able to grow many of the vital organs of the body and, rather than allow the organs we\u2019re born with to become old and decrepit, we\u2019ll replace them. That\u2019s all coming. And it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to realise it.If you were to create a settlement on an another planet, here\u2019s the problem. In the old days, when settlers landed in some new place, they could breathe the air. They could repair their ships with wood from trees. Fruit grew on plants. Basic life support existed. But it won\u2019t for the new generation of settlers. You cannot breathe on Mars, so you will need to seed the soil, generate oxygen \u2013 terraform it. That\u2019s not an inconceivable future path for us, but it is a level of geo-engineering we\u2019ve yet to master. When you\u2019ve terraformed a planet, OK, we can talk about moving there. But until that happens we\u2019d be living in a habitat that\u2019s simulating Earth. And what\u2019s the point in doing that? Antarctica is balmier and wetter than Mars, and you don\u2019t see developers clambering to build condos in Antarctica.By 2050, I can imagine Mars becoming a vacation site. Instead of going to the beach, people will spend money to go and hang out in space. I\u2019d do that! But that\u2019s a business model that has yet to be set up. There\u2019s no infrastructure. No way to make food or fuel. How would people get back to home-base Earth?If humanity wanted to \u2013 if we had the motivation \u2013 we might be able to turn at least the near solar system into our backyard. It will be difficult. Elon Musk famously said: \u201cHow do you build a small fortune in space? Start with a big fortune.\u201d But if we were to manage it, we\u2019d have access to what are essentially unlimited resources. Asteroids are rich in various metallic and mineral ingredients \u2013 rare Earth elements \u2013 that are fundamental to modern civilisation: gold, silver, platinum, iridium, cadmium, osmium. Comets have unlimited supplies of water. The world\u2019s first trillionaire will be the first person to exploit these resources. Imagine having the capacity to distribute those resources where they are most needed around the world? Something like a third of conflicts are based on the limited access to resources. If, by 2050, we had unlimited global access, would those wars still exist?This all points to the growing importance of space, particularly for commerce. The future value of space assets won\u2019t be measured by the amount of hardware that\u2019s orbiting the Earth, but by the amount of commerce that hardware enables. Think about Uber. Its entire business model is founded on the existence of GPS satellites. Or Tinder. Want to date someone nearby? You\u2019re relying on GPS. Satellites generate hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. That\u2019s a kind of power; governments might call it \u201csoft power\u201d. So by 2050 space will have become a hotly contested zone.If there is conflict in the future, a nation\u2019s best move might be to take out its enemy\u2019s space assets, bringing down its economy. But would you use space to wage war on Earth, rather than to mine its resources and grow the world economy? Wherever you have a healthy economy, people tend to live longer and be happier. For 2050, that\u2019s a noble goal.AHuman doctors have a problem: they\u2019re human. They make mistakes. They don\u2019t show up. They get sick. So algorithms will replace them, providing patients with the function of a doctor 24/7. Artificial intelligence will inform us very early on in our lives what we are allergic to, what our sensitivities are, how much exercise we require, what our stress levels are.We\u2019re already finding that AI psychologists are extremely effective. They\u2019re able to measure a patient\u2019s responses to questions. They understand which questions provoke stress. They measure a patient\u2019s biometrics during sessions. Human therapists can\u2019t do that. They can\u2019t take all that information in.This might all have happened by 2030, let alone 2050. By that point, science fiction will have become just science. Everything will be implanted: the ability to dispense medicine (the \u201crobo-release\u201d), the ability to predict cancer, the ability to measure the function of our heart or lungs. Tiny chips will be implanted within our bodies at birth, around the same moment you cut the umbilical cord. We will store our medical records in our fingertips.We won\u2019t be having babies naturally by that point. Pregnancy will have become outdated. People will grow babies in labs, or their living rooms, in what look like fish tanks. And gender will have become irrelevant.We\u2019re already witnessing gender fluidity. Facebook has 71 kinds of gender; 48% of millennials believe that gender is a spectrum \u2013 they don\u2019t identify as strictly homo- or heterosexual. All of the traditional grounds for gender \u2013 the idea that one gender takes care of the other, or bosses it around, however you see it \u2013 will disappear. We are at a mid-stage now \u2013 and it\u2019s sticky. The \u201cleft-behinds\u201d will be those people who can\u2019t adapt or don\u2019t want to \u2013 the Luddites. White men in their 50s and 60s. The whole white male thing is going to fall over.Race will become obsolete, too. I predicted in 1988 that everybody will be brown, eventually. But what won\u2019t become obsolete, and what could become problematic, is intelligence: how smart you can become through the AI you can buy, how many drugs you can afford to micro-dose throughout the day, to make you sharper and more able.There will be many people who don\u2019t have the money to access new kinds of medical enhancement. There will be the people with, and the people without \u2013 unless a social class develops that decides to save those without. That could happen. Hopefully.There\u2019s a lovely phrase, attributed to the futurist , that goes like this: \u201cWe tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\u201d With this in mind, let\u2019s consider work. We\u2019re already discussing what kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. We know that some of the losers will be those with white-collar qualifications whose work is relatively routine: accountants, much of the work of lawyers, some of the work of journalists. But by 2050 we\u2019ll begin to see paradigmatic changes. We have all these assumptions about how work and the world is shifting. But the changes occurring now are too incipient for us to get our heads around. It\u2019s not that automation will change work. It\u2019s that work will change so drastically that we\u2019ll need to give what we do an entirely different name.The winners will be those people in jobs we don\u2019t even know about yet, at the intersection of technology and other fields. Data and criminal justice. Data and homewares. Data and medical services. Data and biotechnology. It will be an exciting time for philosophers and ethicists. We\u2019ll quickly realise the need to understand how we treat, use, manage and live with artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll need philosophers and ethicists to legislate ourselves into the future.If there is a significant displacement from automation, we\u2019ll require a tweak in the social services system. We\u2019ll send people back to school. We\u2019ll find new ways for people to make money. There will be experiments in the universal basic income. Eventually, we\u2019ll create new forms of work. We\u2019re kind of an ingenious race that way.But the one thing that seems unlikely to change in the next 30 years is wealth inequality. This will reverberate across generations. Some of us will continue to become really rich; some of us will continue to become very poor. Inequality won\u2019t rise from automation alone. It will continue to develop from the kind of economic reward system we\u2019ve already established: that money makes money. That will lead to a biological divide in society, too. There will be a class of people able to enhance not only their education, as people have been able to do for decades \u2013 you go to a private school, you get a better education \u2013 but their own bodies, through other kinds of augmentation.

Probably not", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/24/eu-wont-miss-britain-after-brexit", "content": "n 24 June 2016, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Martin Schulz issued the EU\u2019s first formal response to a decision they described in a  as \u201cregrettable\u201d, but said they respected.The bloc stood united, the presidents of the European commission, council and parliament said. Defence of its stability and interests was its priority, so any  agreement with the UK would be \u201cbalanced \u2026 in terms of rights and obligations\u201d.In the days that followed, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then France\u2019s president, put meat on the bones of that anodyne little phrase. \u201cThere can be,\u201d Merkel told the Bundestag \u2013 adopting a term destined to become famous \u2013  There must, she stressed, be \u201ca palpable difference between countries who are members of the European family, and those who are not.\u201dHollande was even plainer: an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d EU was not on the menu, he said. Being in the single market \u201chas advantages. .Two-and-a-half years on, the withdrawal agreement and political declaration are all but complete, and the first phase of the process is finally over \u2013 at least for the EU27.A lot on the continent has changed since. Regret remains, but a page has turned.Schulz has sunk without trace in Germany; Hollande is no longer president of France; Merkel will not stand again. Populist, far-right and Eurosceptic parties have risen (or returned) to power in Italy, Austria and Hungary and made record gains in Sweden.However, in a famously fractious bloc which is often unable to agree on anything much, the common understanding on Brexit reached, very rapidly, by 27 different capitals in early summer 2016 has not just survived but intensified into an unlikely unity of purpose that, ultimately, made the divorce talks\u2019 outcome inevitable.Each individual EU member state may be facing different consequences and costs from Brexit, and each \u2013 as well as the bloc\u2019s central institutions \u2013 necessarily has a different experience of the talks. But ask for their top Brexit takeaway so far, and the most common response is: EU solidarity matters, and it works.That, and some surprise at the UK\u2019s ineptitude. \u201cIt was clear to most Europeans that the Brexiters\u2019 promises were empty,\u201d said Anna-Lena H\u00f6genauer of Luxembourg\u2019s Institute of Political Sciences. \u201cMost, though, thought it was just politics, that there was some kind of plan behind the rhetoric.\u201dThe discovery that there was not, H\u00f6genauer said, was something of a shock. \u201cThe UK basically jumped into the ocean blindfold, and started paddling round in circles. It was almost like it expected the EU not just to say what Brexit should look like, but to devise a version of it that would suit Britain.\u201dEurope\u2019s unity was far from a given at the outset, said Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre, a leading Brussels thinktank. \u201cThere was real regret, of course, but also huge uncertainty, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum,\u201d Zuleeg said. \u201cReal concern, if not fear, of what might come next, and of how the process might unfold.\u201cBut it led to a quite remarkable coming together of the EU. The key red lines, and the sequencing, were set very early.\u201dThe EU, uncharacteristically, was moving purposefully on. \u201cIt was an existential moment,\u201d said Salvador Llaudes, of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma of Madrid. \u201cA moment of truth. There was an understanding that a partner was leaving \u2013 not just any partner \u2013 and that how the EU responded would decide its future.\u201dThe foundations of Michel Barnier\u2019s mandate as the European Union\u2019s chief negotiator \u2013 no negotiation before article 50; no cherry-picking benefits of the single market without accepting all its obligations; no trade talks before Brexit \u2013 were laid at an EU summit held less than a week after the referendum. And they have not budged significantly since.\u201cThat political mandate was established fast, and Barnier has executed it faithfully,\u201d said Guntram Wolff of the European thinktank Bruegel.\u201cHe travelled to all the capitals, took on board every view. It\u2019s proved a highly efficient mechanism, one voice speaking for all.\u201dIt helped, Wolff said, that most member states were \u201conly too happy not to have to worry about the day-to-day details of such a complicated and painful procedure. They have a lot of other stuff on their plates. For many, Brexit very quickly became a second-tier, even a third-tier, issue.\u201dNot for all. The Dutch, who have calculated that even a best-case Brexit could knock 1.2% off their economy by 2030, have been \u201cpragmatic and pro-active\u201d perhaps more than any other country, said Sarah de Lange of the University of Amsterdam.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u00a0That committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u00a0But it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u00a0The problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u00a0If the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u00a0The backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u00a0The new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u00a0But an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u00a0The Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u00a0 a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0Extending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between \u00a310bn and \u00a317bn.\u00a0Staying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u00a0European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u00a0\u201cWe are so dependent on an open economy and trade that we started work almost immediately on minimising Brexit\u2019s impact,\u201d De Lange said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in a lot of hard work, really a lot, to ensure a smooth transition, no matter what the Brexit outcome is. We\u2019re prepared.\u201dFor Germany, said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund, economic issues, while real, were largely outweighed by broader geopolitical concerns: \u201cWhere will Britain stand on the global stage; can it remain an outward-looking country and not be utterly consumed by Brexit?\u201dBut Berlin\u2019s overriding priority, Speck said, was \u201cto protect our common European space. If we open it up, it will unravel.\u201cEven in countries with governments sometimes highly critical of the EU, what mattered was not to rock the boat. This has not been about punishing Britain, but about protecting the EU.\u201dAnd German business, with its formidable car industry, was never going to push Merkel for a soft deal for Britain, as Brexiters fondly imagined, Speck added. \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple: German companies care a lot more about the single market than about the British market. Germany\u2019s national interests lie with the EU.\u201dFrance, too, has commercial interests to defend, said Christian Lequesne of SciencesPo Paris, including transport and fisheries: more than 50% of its Brittany, Normandy and north coast fleets\u2019 catch comes from UK waters. But national interests have largely been subsumed in the \u201cremarkable cohesive effect\u201d of Brexit.\u201cBritain\u2019s strategic error was to threaten the integrity of the single market\u201d by suggesting that full access and frictionless trade were possible outside it, said Lequesne. \u201cFor France and Germany in particular, that\u2019s the EU\u2019s soul.\u201dHowever, Brexit has also had an impact on the continent\u2019s Eurosceptics, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s striking. Before and right after the referendum, the talk was Frexit, Nexit, Czexit. It all stopped very quickly. In France, Marine Le Pen wanted to leave the EU, then the euro, now she wants to leave neither. No one wants to.\u201dFirst, Lequesne said, Britain\u2019s experience \u201chas shown how complicated leaving is. Second, Brexit has boosted popular support for the EU.\u201d shows that 68% of respondents feel their country benefits from EU membership, the highest level since 1983, while 66% \u2013 a majority in every state \u2013 said they would vote to remain in any exit referendum.In Poland, said Natasza Styczy\u0144ska of Jagiellonian university \u2013 co-author of  by the UK in a Changing EU thinktank on EU attitudes to Brexit \u2013 the key concerns were the rights of the 1 million-plus Polish citizens in the UK, and the UK\u2019s EU budget contribution.Spain was worried about its corporate interests and citizens in the UK, and for the 300,000-plus Brits in Spain. It \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d Brexit, wanted a strong future relationship with the UK \u2013 but always saw EU solidarity, and the single market, as greater priorities, Llaudes said.Luxembourg\u2019s key concern was for an orderly Brexit, particularly in arrangements for the financial sector, said H\u00f6genauer \u2013 but like most EU27 members, the duchy was taken aback by the events that unfolded across the Channel.If the early setting of the EU27\u2019s red lines made it \u201cvery hard indeed for the UK to get a grip on any part of the process\u201d, Zuleeg said, Britain really did not help itself: \u201cNormally in negotiations you reach a compromise position, then present it to the other side. Britain couldn\u2019t get to the compromise.\u201dSo the government kept postponing any internal decision on its Brexit position. \u201cIt could not really use its civil service,\u201d Zuleeg said. \u201cIt could not \u2013 a huge disadvantage in a negotiation \u2013 do any drafting of its own, only try to amend what the EU had already drafted. It could not, actually, negotiate.\u201dSo the process so far has been determined by two key factors: the EU\u2019s unity, and Britain\u2019s fundamental, and insoluble, dilemma. \u201cThe EU forced it to choose between breaking the political promises made by Brexiters,\u201d said Zuleeg, \u201cor incurring significant economic harm. It couldn\u2019t.\u201dIt is a view echoed in several capitals. In Berlin, said Speck, there was \u201cirritation and surprise at the chaos\u201d across the Channel. \u201cEveryone reads the UK papers here. We saw it all, every comment, every contradiction ... People were laughing \u2013 rolling their eyes \u2013 at some of the most extreme, the most arrogant, stuff.\u201dIf the unpleasant rhetoric was amusing, the sheer length of time the UK took to publish its Brexit white paper was frustrating, and the ultimatums (\u201cmy plan or no plan\u201d) and clumsy diplomatic attempts at divide-and-rule were annoying.But it was the UK\u2019s many and persistent delusions \u2013 on \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d as a third country; on a special cake-and-eat-it deal; on avoiding a hard Irish border while leaving the single market and maintaining territorial integrity; on viewing the EU as a political arrangement, not a legal order \u2013 that have ultimately proved fatal.With the deal sealed on the EU side, Zuleeg said he now expects it to pass through the House of Commons, possibly on a second vote. \u201cThe economic pressure will be enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we now have to negotiate the worst trade deal in history \u2013 the only one that\u2019s a reduction on what we have.\u201cAll the big issues: fisheries, Gibraltar, will come back with a vengeance, with the backstop hanging over us. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d"},

She insisted that to be true (and as light as the originals) they should be made with two different pastries.

Wrap in plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for about 20 minutes.While your doughs are resting, place the boiling water and sugar in a bowl and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside to cool.On a well-floured surface, roll out the water dough to a 30cm \u00d7 20cm rectangle. Quickly roll out the butter dough to roughly the same size. Place the butter dough on top of the water dough then, with a short side nearest to you, fold the dough into thirds, like a letter. Remember them? Give the dough a quarter turn clockwise and roll out gently to roughly the same size as the original rectangle. Repeat the folding and rolling two more times, flouring the work surface as you go. If the dough feels too soft at any stage, wrap it up and return to the fridge for 20 minutes. When you have finished rolling and folding, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and rest in the fridge.When the sugar and water mixture has cooled, add the remaining ingredients, whisk until well combined, then strain twice through a fine sieve.Preheat the oven to 190C/170C fan-forced.

Gently press the rounds into each hole, then pour over the custard until the pastry shells are almost full.

And can anyone be prosecuted for killing him?\u201cIt is certainly the most unique case in my career,\u201d said Dependra Pathak, who left his post overseeing traffic policing in the Indian capital Delhi five months ago to become the director general of law enforcement in the Andamans.Police have attempted one aerial survey and two by boat since Chau\u2019s death was first reported to officers on Tuesday. A helicopter flew over the island on Wednesday but kept its distance: the Sentinelese, an isolated tribe at least 30,000 years old, have shot arrows at helicopters that have approached too closely in the past.On Friday, police sailed to within about 300 metres of the island, bringing one of the fishermen alleged to have assisted Chau to reach the shore, and who says he saw his body being buried there on 17 November.\u201cWe located the place of this incidence and got a sketch map \u2013 this is a mandatory requirement in a criminal investigation,\u201d Pathak said. \u201cFor about three hours we watched, and in this time we saw five or six Sentinelese moving about on the beach.\u201cThey were carrying a bow and arrow and looking towards sea side. I would say they were very watchful.\u201dPolice are interviewing anthropologists who have studied or interacted with the tribe, loosely estimated to number 100 people, for clues on how they respond in the aftermath of death.\u201cBecause they have killed somebody from outside, they have to have suffered a psychological shock,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstanding this will help us in observing them and to draw a strategy if we want to move forward.\u201dWhen a boat ran aground on North Sentinel Island in 2006, the two fishermen onboard were killed and buried in the sand. After about a week, according to police records, the tribespeople dug up the pair and hung them from bamboo poles facing the ocean.Should the Sentinelese do the same with Chau, it could present the only opportunity to identify or retrieve his body.\u201cAs per our information in that [2006] case, after five to seven days they had taken the body out of the sand and made it stand with the help of bamboo, facing the sea,\u201d said Pathak.A criminal case has been registered against \u201cunknown tribesmen\u201d, in line with mandatory police procedures, but Pathak said it was unclear if police could even lawfully land on the island to arrest someone. \u201cAs per law, no one can go there, not even police,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is a responsibility and obligation on us to handle the case with great sensitivity because there is a small group, in a small place, and they have their own civilisation and world view. We have no plans to barge in and have a confrontation,\u201d he said.Kanchan Mukhopadhyay, a researcher with the Anthropological Survey of  who was previously stationed in the Andamans, said trying to retrieve Chau\u2019s body threw up too many problems to be realistic.\u201cIt\u2019s a restricted area and the government has decided a hands-off policy,\u201d he said. \u201cOne has to go there, land there \u2013 and if they resist, what are we going to do?\u201dHe said Chau, who wrote that he wanted to \u201cdeclare Jesus\u201d to the Sentinelese, had knowingly violated the will of the tribe. \u201cAnd this retrieval of the tribe will again violate the will of the people.\u201dSeven people including five fishermen have been arrested for helping Chau reach close to the island \u2013 which he had labelled \u201cSatan\u2019s last abode\u201d in his diary \u2013 on the evening of 14 September. According to his journal entries, he managed to set foot on the shore the following day, but was chased back on to the boat by the Sentinelese.He wrote that night: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die. Would it be wiser to leave and let someone else continue? No. I don\u2019t think so. I still could make it back to the US somehow, as it almost seems like certain death to stay here.\u201dThe next afternoon, he kayaked back to the island. Two fishermen saw the Sentinelese dragging his body and burying it the next morning.The Sentinelese are regarded as one of the world\u2019s most isolated communities, resisting both British colonisers and efforts by Indian administrators to integrate them into the surrounding islands. Since 1996 the Indian government has had a policy of leaving the tribe alone, enforcing a buffer zone around their island."},

Large numbers were sexually and physically abused, while hunger and neglect were familiar enemies.

Some 4,000 were sent to Australia, a mass emigration captured in the 2010 film , which starred Emily Watson as Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham who uncovered the scandal.But for many children, the promised land failed to deliver.

Witnesses described \u201ccare\u201d regimes which included physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well as neglect. \u201cSome described constant hunger, medical neglect and poor education, the latter of which had, in several instances, lifelong consequences,\u201d the report found. \u201cBy any standards of child care, then or at the present time, all of this was wrong.\u201d A former child migrant said his experiences at one school were \u201cbetter described as torture than abuse\u201d, and recounted how he was locked in a place known as \u201cthe dungeon\u201d without food or water for days.Another told of \u201cbackbreaking\u201d work on the construction of a school building. A third spoke of a failure to give him medical care, which resulted in the loss of an eye. In some places, there were persistent beatings, and one witness described how he had tried to kill himself at the age of 12.Michael, who was placed with the Christian Brothers in Perth, Western Australia, where he was raped, abused and starved, told the inquiry he felt abandoned by his country. He recounted how one Brother \u201corganised special punishment days for the boys, during which he would make them watch horses being killed\u201d. The children were so hungry they hunted in bins for scraps and on one occasion roasted a cat to eat.When it published its findings, the IICSA recommended that a redress scheme for all child migrants should start within 12 months \u2013 1 March 2019 at the latest. A similar inquiry in Australia established a redress scheme in little over six months.In July, Jackie Doyle-Price, the mental health and inequalities minister, confirmed the government intended to give a formal response to the recommendations by the summer recess. But the deadline came and went, according to the IAFCM&F, a delay it says has meant some victims will never receive what the UK owes them. \u201cTo date, at least 21 former child migrants are known to have passed away without justice since the report was issued,\u201d said Johnston, who was abused at an Australian Christian Brothers\u2019 home. \u201cFor them, for those child migrants who gave their painful testimony before the inquiry, and for those of us still waiting, we cannot sit by waiting for the government to do the right thing.\u201dActing for the association, the law firm Leigh Day has sent a Letter Before Claim to the Department of Health and the Home Office, threatening a high court challenge over the perceived failure to respond to the inquiry\u2019s recommendations. The legal challenge threatens to embarrass the government after accusations it was slow to pay compensation to members of the Windrush generation whose status as British citizens was disputed by the Home Office.\u201cConsecutive governments have let these British citizens down,\u201d said Alison Millar, a partner at Leigh Day. \u201cFirst as children deported to foreign lands without any safeguards, then as adults left to cope alone with what they had endured and now this government, faced with recommendations from its own inquiry, is letting them down again in their advancing years. Following the shameful delays to establish compensation to help the Windrush generation, this again appears to be a case of putting elderly British citizens at the back of the queue while internal political squabbles take precedence.\u201dA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u201cWe are carefully considering the findings and recommendations made in the report and will provide a considered response to the inquiry\u2019s recommendations in due course.\u201d"},

If we were able to create such a machine, he mused, it would be \u201cthe last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control\u201d.Note the proviso. Good\u2019s speculation has lingered long in our collective subconscious, occasionally giving rise to outbreaks of fevered speculation. These generally focus on two questions. How long will it take us to create superintelligent machines? And what will it be like for humans to live with \u2013 or under \u2013 such machines? Will they rapidly conclude that people are a waste of space? Does the superintelligent machine pose an existential risk for humanity?The interesting thing about tech companies is that, until recently, we failed to notice that they were just corporationsThe answer to the first question can be summarised as \u201clonger than you think\u201d. And as for the second question, well, nobody really knows. How could they? Surely we\u2019d need to build the machines first and then we\u2019d find out. Actually, that\u2019s not quite right. It just so happens that history has provided us with some useful insights into what it\u2019s like to live with \u2013 and under \u2013 superintelligent machines.They\u2019re called corporations, and they\u2019ve been around for a very long time \u2013 . Although they are powered by human beings, they are in fact nonhuman entities to which our legal systems grant the status of legal personhood. We can therefore regard them as artificial superintelligences because they possess formidable capacities for rational behaviour, reasoning, perception and action. And they have free will: they can engage in purposeful behaviour aimed at achieving self-determined goals. They possess and deploy massive resources of financial capital and human expertise. And they are, in principle at least, immortal: they can have life spans that greatly exceed those of humans, and some are capable of surviving catastrophes that kill millions of people. Just think of how many of the big German corporations of the 1930s \u2013 companies such as Thyssen, BASF, Mercedes, Siemens, Bosch, Volkswagen \u2013 are still prospering today.So if corporations are the superintelligences , what can that tell us about living with superintelligent machines? On the positive side, such entities are capable of accomplishing astonishing things \u2013 from building a new city, road or rail network, to indexing the world wide web, connecting 2.24 billion people, scanning all the world\u2019s books, launching heavy rockets into space (), etc.But these superintelligent entities have other characteristics too. The most disturbing one is that they are intrinsically sociopathic \u2013 they are AIs that stand apart from the rest of society, existing for themselves and only for themselves, caring nothing for the norms and rules of society, and obeying only the letter (as distinct from the spirit) of the law.That doesn\u2019t means that corporations do not regularly dissemble, or proclaim their \u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d, ethical standards, environmental awareness or the \u201cvalues\u201d that are implicit in their brands. They do. For the most part, though, this is just cant, designed to burnish the public image of the corporation.Artificial Intelligence has various definitions, but in general it means a program that uses data to build a model of some aspect of the world. This model is then used to make informed decisions and predictions about future events. The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites. In the future, it could deliver driverless cars, smart personal assistants, and intelligent energy grids. AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law. The interesting thing about the tech companies is that, until recently, we failed to notice that they were just corporations too. At the beginning, we were entranced by their young founders with their open-eyed \u201cmissions\u201d to avoid being evil, enable people to broadcast themselves, connect the world, organise its information and build global communities. We were likewise seduced by their colourful, playful workplaces, free gourmet food, on-site massages and prevailingly hipster ethos, so didn\u2019t notice that under all that gloss there lurked ruthless capitalist machines intent on harvesting as much data on our daily existence as they could. Fortunately, after two years of scandals, the scales are now beginning to fall from our eyes and we are seeing these outfits for what they are: mere corporations. Anyone who has been on the receiving end of a tech company\u2019s rage \u2013 as this newspaper was on the Friday night that we broke the  story \u2013 would be hard put to say what is the difference between Facebook and, say, a tobacco company whose cover had been blown. Which is why the recent revelations by the  that Facebook had been employing a slimy PR firm to  \u2013 a long-time target of antisemitic conspiracy theories \u2013 no longer came as a shock. When you\u2019re a sociopathic corporation, the ends always justify the means. So the challenge we will one day face is whether we can design superintelligent machines that are better behaved.The website New Atlas reports on the commodification of machine-learning technology.

I\u2019m all ears", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/commentisfree/2018/nov/24/writing-tips-jonathan-franzen", "content": "oor Jonathan Franzen, as literally no one says these days. Last week the acclaimed novelist and, to many, human embodiment of white male privilege  and, as tends to happen any time Franzen dares to open his mouth, he was thanked for his trouble with derision.Small sidenote here, but I really don\u2019t get the Franzen loathing. Sure, he could lighten up on the    , but otherwise the things Franzen is hated for are either not really hateworthy or not actually his fault. This all began in ye olden times of 2001 with the famous, nay, legendary saga of Oprah Winfrey choosing Franzen\u2019s novel, The Corrections, for her book club and . Winfrey\u2019s book choices were often, he said, not incorrectly, \u201cschmaltzy\u201d. It was the snub heard around the world and Franzen was for ever cast as an elitist snob, his every pronouncement since (he hates social media! He likes nature!) taken as further evidence of his hatefulness, even though surely most people would love to live a nice, Twitter-free, nature-based life in California, as Franzen does.A more credible argument against him, , is that he gets the kind of critical adulation denied to female writers, but I\u2019m not really sure what Franzen is supposed to do about that. Increasingly, it feels like Franzen is a scapegoat for white guilt, a white liberal even other white liberals can hate, so they feel less bad about themselves. He would have had to have been invented if he didn\u2019t exist. Fortunately, he does exist, but no one seems very grateful for it.So, predictably,  Franzen\u2019s rules for writing, which mixed the benignly helpful (avoid the internet and fancy verbs) with the unexpectedly koan-esque (\u201cYou have to love before you can be relentless.\u201d) Interestingly, most of the hatred came from other writers, such as novelist , \u201cIn which Jonathan Franzen reveals himself to be that guy who mentions Ayn Rand in his Tinder profile.\u201d But as writing rules go, I\u2019ve read a lot worse, and so I think we can conclude that the anger here isn\u2019t really about the rules, but about Franzen, and even that isn\u2019t really about Franzen, either.I read  all the time, not because I think they\u2019ll magically make me into as good a writer as, say, Tolstoy (\u201cThe best thoughts most often come in the morning after waking while still in bed\u201d) or Hemingway (\u201cAlways stop while you are going good and don\u2019t worry about it until you start to write the next day\u201d), but because I\u2019m nosy and these tips invariably say a lot more about the author than they do about writing (Tolstoy knew the value of staying in bed; Hemingway was a machismo-riddled bolter who left writing sessions as casually as he left wives).The brilliant screenwriter, novelist and all round mensch, William Goldman, who died last week, was able to write stage directions more interesting than most novels: \u201cThirty-five and bright, [Butch Cassidy] has brown hair, but most people, if asked to describe him, would remember him as blond. He speaks well and quickly, and has been all his life a leader of men; but if you asked him he would be damned if he could tell you why.\u201d I\u2019ve read Goldman\u2019s extremely enjoyable writing advice (\u201cThou shalt know thy world as God knows this one\u201d), from his book, Adventures In The Screen Trade, about 1,017 times and \u2013 spoiler \u2013 I have yet to write a tenth as well as him. Similarly, Stephen King\u2019s book, On Writing, is one of the most spine-cracked books in my home, and still that blockbuster novel eludes me.The popularity of writing tips suggests a lot of people see fiction as a hobby anyone could knock off if they just knew the right tricks, as opposed to a job and a skill, and one requiring a serious amount of unique talent (although if Franzen said this, I honestly think he\u2019d be pushed out into the Pacific Ocean on an ice floe).Teachers and plumbers aren\u2019t asked for their top 10 tips on how to do their job. Even acting \u2013 the only profession seen as more self-indulgent than writing \u2013 doesn\u2019t sell this fallacy; no one\u2019s asking Meryl Streep for her tips on how to play a bereaved mother, or Robert De Niro for his top 10 techniques for playing a mafia boss. The idea that any of us could write as well as Franzen, Goldman, or whoever, by literally writing like them is as absurd as suggesting that buying the same handbag as Kate Moss will make you look like the supermodel.But given that everyone seems to be giving writing tips these days, here are mine, which precisely no one asked for:1. Write something. Hate it.2. Wonder why so many people want tips on how to do something that brings you only self-loathing.3. Write more. Still hate it.4. Read about how much people hate Franzen to cheer yourself up.5. Repeat."},

{"title": "The ancient mixed-heritage mystery girl", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/24/denisovan-neanderthal-hybrid-denny-dna-finder-project", "content": "f all the ancient peoples that have been studied by scientists, none has set puzzles quite so profound as those left behind by the Denisovans. Only a few tiny pieces of bone and teeth have ever been found of this long extinct species \u2013 fragmentary remains that would all fit snugly inside a cigarette packet.Yet these fossil scraps suggest that Denisovans had a considerable influence on people today. Up to 6% of the genes now found in modern New Guineans and 3-5% of the DNA of aboriginal Australians is made up of Denisovan DNA, scientists have discovered. The gene that allows Tibetan people to survive high altitudes is also believed to have been inherited from them. This information tells us one thing: tens of thousands of years ago, modern humans encountered Denisovans \u2013 and had sex with them. It is a startling discovery that raises many basic questions. Just who were the Denisovans? What did they look like? And what were their relations with the Neanderthals, their closest evolutionary cousins? Did they have tools and art like the ?At present, researchers have few answers to these questions, such is the paucity of the Denisovan fossil record. But a new project,  \u2013 Fossil Fingerprinting and Identification of New Denisovan Remains from Pleistocene Asia \u2013 which has been just been launched with backing from the European Research Council, aims to put that right and transform our knowledge of the Denisovans and their relations with both  and the Neanderthals. All three species interbred, we now know, and a key aim of the study is to help understand these complex bondings: Denisovans will be a special focus, however.\u201cWe aim to find out where they lived, when they came into contact with modern humans \u2013 and why they went extinct,\u201d says project leader Katerina Douka, of the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany and a visitor at Oxford University.Denisovan research faces a basic problem, however \u2013 paucity of fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia \u2013 where their eponymous remains were first found in 2010 \u2013 is our sole source, and only a handful of fossils have ever been dug up there (along with several Neanderthal pieces).\u201cIt is a wonderful site,\u201d says Tom Higham, deputy director of Oxford University\u2019s  and an adviser to Finder. \u201cIt is cool inside, so DNA in bones does not disintegrate too badly. However, nearly all the bones there have been chewed up by hyenas and other carnivores.\u201d As a result, Denisova\u2019s cave floor is littered with tiny, unidentifiable bone fragments.\u201cYou cannot tell whether a piece comes from a mammoth or a sheep \u2013 or a man or woman,\u201d adds Higham. \u201cOnly a very few will be human, though they are certainly worth finding \u2013 they could tell us so much.\u201dCurrent techniques for identifying bone fragments involve the time-consuming process of extracting and sequencing DNA. \u201cThat takes far too long to be practical,\u201d says Higham. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of bits of bones here.\u201dHowever, Douka and Higham will use a new technology called  \u2013 ZooMs. Developed by Mike Buckley, at Manchester University, the technique, which is derived from food science research, exploits the fact that collagen, a protein fibre found in bone, can survive for hundreds of thousands of years. Every major mammal group has a distinctive type of collagen, and ZooMs can read its structure like a molecular barcode, identifying which animal was the originator of a particular bone. This makes it ideal for differentiating human and animal remains.\u201cWe asked Anatoly Derevyanko and Mikhail Shunkov, who direct the cave\u2019s excavations, for samples \u2013 and they gave us a big bag full of bits of bones. All the fragments were considered to be unidentifiable,\u201d says Douka.The team began to prepare the bones. A 20mg slice was cut from each and placed in a test tube and given an identification code. After three months, 150 samples had been prepared. \u201cThat was nowhere near enough,\u201d says Higham.So Douka and Higham asked their postgraduate students for a volunteer to work on the project. \u201cNo one came forward,\u201d says Higham. \u201cA week went by, then a fortnight. I was beginning to get worried. Then an Australian student, Samantha Brown, knocked on my door and volunteered to work the bones as part of her master\u2019s dissertation. She saved the day.\u201dOver the next few weeks, Brown undertook the laborious task of cutting and labelling tiny slices from each bone fragment. \u201cI eventually prepared about 700 samples,\u201d she recalls. These were then taken to Manchester for analysis in Buckley\u2019s laboratory. \u201cThe results showed we had a lot of cow bones, a few other animals but no humans,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt was very disappointing.\u201dAt that point, Brown could have left the project with honour. But she chose to go on. \u201cThank God she did,\u201d says Higham. A further 1,500 Denisova bone samples were prepared by her and then taken to Manchester. This time, the results were spectacularly different. One bone, number 1,227, was identified as being from a human species.\u201cWe could not believe that it had actually worked. It was wonderful,\u201d says Douka. Brown was also overjoyed. \u201cIt was unbelievably exciting. We had not only shown the technique works but we had found a hominin. And I had been prepared for the worst.\u201dIt was tremendous news for the team. But their discovery lacked a key piece of information. Yes, they had found a human of some kind, but which species? ZooMs can tell only if a bone comes from a member of the hominidae family, which includes great apes and humans, including , Neanderthals and Denisovans. It cannot differentiate within this group. \u201cThere have never been great apes around Denisova so that meant we had to have found a piece of a human,\u201d says Higham. \u201cBut which species?\u201dTo find out, the sample was taken to Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo at the , whose team had sequenced the first Denisovan genome in 2010. Initial analysis showed that the bone was more than 50,000 years old and from a person who had been 13 or older when they died.Then the Leipzig team \u2013 led by P\u00e4\u00e4bo\u2019s student Viviane Slon \u2013 began more detailed genetic analysis and made a startling discovery. Exactly half the sample consisted of Neanderthal DNA. The other half was made up of Denisovan DNA. At first, the researchers assumed that the sample was contaminated. \u201cI thought they must have screwed up something,\u201d says P\u00e4\u00e4bo.But re-testing confirmed the finding: the Oxford team had discovered the 90,000-year-old remains of. She was nicknamed Denny. \u201cIf you had asked me beforehand, I would have said we will never find this, it is like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d .To discover a first-generation person of mixed ancestry was extraordinary. But there were more revelations to come. Further detailed studies of the genes of Denny\u2019s Denisovan father were found to contain fragments of Neanderthal DNA. These indicated that interbreeding between the two species had also occurred at an earlier time.At first sight, Denny\u2019s remarkable ancestry suggests that Neanderthals and Denisovans must have mated with each other regularly. But Douka counsels caution. \u201cThe DNA of Neanderthals and Denisovans are distinct. We can easily tell them apart. That argues against frequent interbreeding. Otherwise they would have ended up with the same DNA.\u201dPast studies have provided clear evidence that Denisovans and modern humans interbred, and also that Neanderthals and modern humans mated with each. Now, thanks to ZooMs \u2013 which has since been used to pinpoint other ancient human remains \u2013 there is dramatic evidence of Denisovan and Neanderthal intermingling. But why at Denisova?One suggestion is that the cave represents a border outpost for both species, one that was situated at the very eastern edge of the range of the Neanderthals, who were primarily a European species, and at the very western tip of the homelands of the Denisovans, who were an eastern species. Occasionally members from both groups would have reached the cave at the same time \u2013 with amorous consequences.It is an idea borne out by detailed studies of Denny\u2019s Neanderthal mother. Her genes show a particularly close affinity with Neanderthals who lived in Croatia, suggesting that the immediate predecessors of Denny\u2019s mother may have been part of a group who slowly migrated east from Europe towards Denisova \u2013 where she encountered Denny\u2019s father at the outer edges of each other\u2019s homelands.It is an intriguing picture, though much more information is required to confirm it. Scientists have no direct evidence that the Denisovans\u2019 homeland range was primarily to the east of the cave, although the fact that their genes have been detected in the DNA of populations in Australia, New Guinea and other parts of Oceania, provides support for this idea and suggests future searches for sites should be focused on eastern Russia, China and south-east Asia.A great deal more needs to be learned about the Denisovans, says Higham: \u201cWhat was their distribution? What is the earliest evidence for their emergence from the common ancestor they shared with Neanderthals 500,000 years ago? If we could get a bone or two from other sites, that would be tremendously helpful.\u201d One possible source of fossils could include remains of ancient humans that were placed in museums in Asia decades ago. These could be wrongly labelled, and could be Denisovans, researchers suggest. Unfortunately, it has proved difficult to get hold of these specimens for sampling.For their part, Douka and Higham are planning on a number of approaches. One of these will be to collaborate with researchers in Chinese laboratories, teaching them how to use ZooMs, and how to use the technology to uncover more Denisovan sites.\u201cZooMs is going to be crucial to this project,\u201d says Douka. \u201cWe have shown that it is a powerful tool for pinpointing human fossils. That makes it ideal for tracking down Denisovans.\u201dKnowledge of the Denisovan people emerged from studies of ancient genomes, which began 20 years ago when scientists first developed techniques for extracting DNA from fossils and for creating copies of that genetic material which allowed them to study it.Scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig were studying bones and teeth found in Denisova cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, where Neanderthal fossils had been found. One bone and one tooth, they discovered, belonged to a previously unknown species of ancient human.These few fossils proved to be spectacularly rich in genetic material, allowing scientists to sequence entire genomes. It is this detailed information about the Denisovan genome that has demonstrated they interbred with modern humans. Descendants of these unions, carrying small amounts of Denisovan DNA, went on to settle in Melanesia and Australia thousands of years ago.In this way, we can see Denisovan DNA in that of modern humans, though we have no idea what the Denisovans looked like or where, exactly, they lived."},

He invited me to tea at his west London house \u2013 the elegant neighbourhood, incidentally, of his 1970 film Performance. We got on to the subject of the unspeakably painful \u201cdeath\u201d scene at the beginning in which the young daughter of Laura and John, the couple played by Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, drowns in a garden pond while wearing the red anorak to which she is greatly attached.As I was about to talk about symbolism, Roeg interrupted to tell me that while shooting, that little girl\u2019s father had been in attendance, and every time he called \u201cAction\u201d and the girl sank below the water\u2019s surface, this man could not stop himself jumping into the water to save her. No matter how vehemently Roeg assured him it was safe, he just jumped in, again and again. To get the shot, this man almost had to be physically restrained. It was just too real, too painful, too terrifying. Anyone who has seen the film can understand: the fear and the grief are agonisingly real, despite the irrational chill that attends John\u2019s telepathic sense that something is wrong before the event. I can close my eyes now and see Sutherland, crying out in agony, as he heaves his daughter\u2019s dead body out of the water: it is an image as memorable, more memorable, than the famous sex scene or the supernatural encounters in Venice. Roeg\u2019s films, for all their formal daring, their dreamlike and exotic inventions, their narrative-order experiments, were passionate and visceral. You could compare him, at various stages in his career, to Hitchcock and Kubrick \u2013 but Roeg was candid about sex and human relationships in a way that they weren\u2019t.The great sex scene in the Venice hotel room between Christie and Sutherland (invented by Roeg: it does not exist in the Daphne du Maurier short story it was based on) in which scenes of their lovemaking are disorientatingly mixed in with scenes of them dressing afterwards, is one of his great coups. It is intensely erotic, interspersing the languorous aftermath into the sex like a kind of inverted foreplay. And it is a rare example, maybe the only example, of a movie sex scene in which the participants are not having sex for the first time. (Although it is the first lovemaking since their child\u2019s death.) This is sex between two people who know each other very well. And Christie and Sutherland are for me the most convincing married couple in screen history. Only a film-maker of Roeg\u2019s delicacy and humanity could have created such emotional reality in the middle of a scary movie.Don\u2019t Look Now was part of an incredible stretch of great films for Roeg who, after a career in cinematography which would have been quite enough for most mortals, came to directing remarkably late: Performance (1970) Walkabout (1971), Don\u2019t Look Now (1973), The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and Bad Timing (1980). And even after that he continued to make excellent movies, including Insignificance (1985), the Terry Johnson-scripted fantasy of Marilyn Monroe meeting Albert Einstein, Track 29 (1988), the sensually charged Dennis Potter drama with Gary Oldman and Roeg\u2019s partner Theresa Russell, and his Roald Dahl fantasy The Witches (1990) with Anjelica Huston.Performance (co-directed with Donald Cammell) is an extraordinary film which only gets more extraordinary as time goes by: it is a vivid time capsule of the experimental bohemianism of the late 60s and early 70: a gangster movie, a crime movie, a movie by and for freaks that plugged into the zeitgeist just as it was getting blearier and more cynical. James Fox is the London gangster who holes up in the west London pad of the reclusive rock star played by Mick Jagger. The spiritual cousin of Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider (1969), Performance was a freewheeling, free-thinking road movie which stayed put and journeyed into the mind\u2019s dark interior.His Walkabout (1971) was another sexually and spiritually dangerous movie, an Australian new wave gem which deserves to be continually revived on screens big and small, but somehow isn\u2019t: the story of two children who are left alone in the outback and befriend an Indigenous Australian boy who helps them survive. Roeg also here deserves to be noted for working with the great dramatist Edward Bond, and seeing how Bond\u2019s rarely employed brilliance could supercharge the movies.Roeg\u2019s The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) was another unclassifiable, generically unlocatable masterpiece, a film which like Performance harnessed the charisma of a rock god: in this case . It is a glorious concept album of a film, or a hyper-evolved midnight movie cult classic in the manner of Roger Corman, with something of 2001. Bowie is the intergalactic visitor to Earth on a mission to save his own stricken planet. The scene in which he faints and has to be carried into his hotel room has a bizarre, fetishistic eroticism that no other director could even guess at.Bad Timing (1980) is another toweringly transgressive and challenging masterpiece from Roeg, something that at the time upset moralists and thrilled cinephiles (who were also, perhaps, secretly upset as well). Maybe now is the time for cinemas to re-release it in a double bill with Douglas Sirk\u2019s Magnificent Obsession (1954). It also reminds me a little of Dennis Potter\u2019s chilling play Brimstone and Treacle \u2014 and at a further remove, of Almodovar\u2019s Talk to Her. Art Garfunkel plays an American psychiatrist who has conceived an obsession with a beautiful American woman played by Theresa Russell. The agony of their relationship is revealed in disordered scenes. The title of the movie may be an ironic comment on Roeg\u2019s audacious attitude to storytelling, or to the tragic fault in our lives generally: the times being out of joint.And as if that wasn\u2019t enough for us all, he produced a later gem which some consider to be his greatest, and certainly most underrated film: Eureka, in 1983, based on the mysterious true-crime case of Sir Harry Oakes, the fabulously wealthy goldmine owner murdered in his luxurious home. Roeg cast Gene Hackman as the plutocrat whose wealth has somehow transmuted in his mind, through an anti-alchemy of greed and paranoia, into an unending fear that everyone wants to take his money. Eureka is a brilliant Jonsonian parable of human misery.What an extraordinary film-maker Nic Roeg was, a man whose imagination and technique could not be confined to conventional genres. He should be remembered for a clutch of masterly films, but perhaps especially for his classic Don\u2019t Look Now, not merely the best scary movie in history, but one infused with compassion and love."},

It\u2019s Sunday 10 June 2018, the day the reports that Arron Banks, the main funder of Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign, had not one (as he had claimed), but  in the run-up to the EU referendum.\u201cWhat do you want to say to Nigel?\u201d the producer asks. \u201cI want to talk about how the funder of his campaign has systematically lied about his relationship with the Russian government,\u201d I say. \u201cI can\u2019t put you through,\u201d the producer says, an edge of panic in her voice. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist. You know these are important questions. \u201cI\u2019m standing in,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not the usual producer.\u201d She promises to speak to her editor and call me back.No one calls me back.Two days later, I try again. Banks and his business partner Andy Wigmore, the spokesman for the Leave.EU campaign, are on the show to \u201canswer questions\u201d. It\u2019s an interview in the best traditions of a Stalinist show trial \u2013 the man asking them the questions is the man whose campaign they funded \u2013 but even so, they sound spooked. It\u2019s the only occasion in my time of reporting on them that I\u2019ve heard them so subdued and serious.There\u2019s never been an issue with me discussing Farage on other LBC shows such as James O\u2019Brien\u2019s, but, again, I can\u2019t get through. Minutes later, a friend does, and passes me the phone. Actually, I say, just as Farage has built up a head of steam about the Trump-Russia \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, it\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr from the and. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to Carole Cadwalladr of the !\u201d Farage says. In the video of the moment, you can see him frantically motioning his producer with his eyes. The phone line is cut.The man who bankrolled Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign (the source of funds for which is now under criminal investigation) and the campaign\u2019s director of communications.Trump\u2019s former political adviser is trying to establish a pan-European populist foundation, a move that Farage has praised. Farage has credited Breitbart news, which Bannon used to head, as a key influence in the EU referendum result.The former Farage aide and chief Ukip fundraiser was arrested on money-laundering charges at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport in 2016 and subsequently jailed.\u00a0The far-right founder of the Infowars conspiracy website, on which he has interviewed Farage. He had dinner with Farage and Roger Stone at the 2016 Republican Convention.The self-proclaimed \u2018dirty trickster\u2019 of US politics, with a track record reaching back to Watergate and ties to Trump. Dined with Farage at the Republican Convention, 18-21 July 2016.A former EU parliament staffer who uploaded videos of Farage to YouTube. It is claimed he was subject to an internal investigation last year after disseminating Russian propaganda.The Australian WikiLeaks founder, given asylum by the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012, was visited by Farage in March 2017. Assange has been secretly charged by US justice department, although it is not known what the charges relate to.\u00a0The pro-Russian Republican ex-congressman has visited Assange in London. He once shared a photograph of himself enjoying a fishing trip with Farage.The Russian ambassador in London. Has met Farage, and met Banks and Wigmore in London several times. According to emails, discussions included gold and diamond investment opportunities. is so regularly on our airwaves and quoted in the press, but he is rarely held to account. At this point I\u2019ve been writing about him for almost two years, and I have no way of asking him questions. His PR man almost never responds to messages. Doesn\u2019t respond to interview requests.And then on 7 September this year we finally meet. He\u2019s on tour with a one-man show entitled , which has just landed \u2013 somewhat bizarrely \u2013 in Melbourne, Australia. Everything is a bit different here. The day before the event, I receive a notification of a change of venue (were ticket sales perhaps not what Farage might have hoped?). The event has been moved from a mid-sized arena to the conference room of a city centre hotel.What\u2019s more, to get in, I have to fight my way through what feels like a running street battle. In Melbourne, Farage isn\u2019t known as the Ukip man off the radio and telly. \u201cHe\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s fascist sidekick and we don\u2019t want his type here,\u201d claims one of the protesters. He\u2019s holding a placard that depicts Farage as a pig.Inside, it\u2019s different. The audience \u2013 overwhelmingly male, surprisingly young \u2013 laps up his well-rehearsed bonhomie. And afterwards, for an extra A$200 on my ticket fee, I get to hang out backstage with a select crowd drinking bad white wine. And then, here he is.Hello, Nigel, I say, and introduce myself. He blinks. But, he doesn\u2019t flee for the exit. Not straight away. It\u2019s been frustrating, I say, because I\u2019ve just wanted to ask you some direct questions. Will you do a proper interview with me?\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know!\u201d he says, with a flash of the trademark Farage charm. \u201cMaybe. It depends what mood I\u2019m in. I don\u2019t work for you. I don\u2019t have to do it, do I?\u201dNo, I say, but you\u2019re a public figure. You\u2019re funded by taxpayers. The  funds you. We pay taxes that pay for you.\u201cWell, who funds you?\u201d he says. \u201cThe funds me,\u201d I say.\u201cGeorge Soros, is it?\u201dI can\u2019t quite believe that he\u2019s said this, apparently in all seriousness. Banks has also accused me of being funded by Soros. And I\u2019ve heard Farage using the phrase in the European parliament. It\u2019s a reference to , the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist, who after the fall of communism, funded democracy-building institutions and movements across eastern Europe. He became a hate figure to the Russian government, who launched a propaganda campaign portraying him as a meddling Jewish banker.What \u201cfunded by Soros\u201d really means is: \u201cfunded by Jews\u201d. It signals antisemitism to an audience without saying it directly. But the only audience is me. I\u2019m gobsmacked. Could he actually believe this stuff?\u201cGeorge Soros doesn\u2019t fund me!\u201d I say. \u201cHow could George Soros fund me?\u201d\u201cWell I don\u2019t know!\u201d Farage says. \u201cYou think the Russians fund me!\u201dAnd then his minder appears. I have moments to put my question, the question that kicked it all off. Why did you visit Julian Assange? I say in a hurry.\u201cLBC organised that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seem to be so stuck in your sad little world. They sent me. LBC wanted the interview. You can\u2019t seem to get that into your mind. Why would my press officer, I mean my producer, come with me?\u201dAnd then he\u2019s gone.It\u2019s the briefest of brief encounters and yet our exchange is so instructive. Because from the Kremlin, \u201cSoros\u201d as a political smear spread to the likes of Hungary\u2019s demagogue-in-training, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and was picked up a year ago by Farage. When the Electoral Commission opened an investigation into the sources of Arron Banks\u2019s funding a year ago, Farage made a speech in the European parliament in which this development on Soros. \u201cThis is where the real international political collusion is.\u201d From Britain, it leapfrogged to the US, where it\u2019s been deployed by Trump supporters about the \u201ccaravans\u201d of immigrants heading for the US border with Mexico. Last week, it descended to the final circle of this hell: Facebook. The  reported that after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook hired a right-leaning opposition research firm who used accusations of \u201cSoros funding\u201d to smear the company\u2019s critics. In a way, the anti-Soros propaganda illuminates everything I\u2019ve been trying to understand about Farage\u2019s place in today\u2019s world: that he represents a bridge between the authoritarian far right parties of central and eastern Europe that are aligned with Russia, and Trump\u2019s America.It all feels a long way from West Kent golf club and the undulating greens outside Farage\u2019s childhood home. His autobiography describes his time at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982 (he left the public school with few if any O-levels \u2013 accounts vary), and how a meeting at the golf club led to his first job as a commodities trader on the London Metal Exchange with a minor City firm. For years, this has been the image that Farage has cultivated. The tweed jackets. The pints. The Little Englander who lived modestly in a Kent suburban home and spoke to Britain\u2019s G&T belt. Even in 2014, he said in an interview that he realised he must reach beyond his core base, which he describes as \u201cvery middle class, very below the M4, ex-military\u201d.This is no longer Farage\u2019s world. He left that world far behind some time ago. But there\u2019s a time lag in Britain in understanding this. In understanding Farage\u2019s relationships with the European far right. And in understanding that he\u2019s using the same playbook as the Kremlin, Steve Bannon (Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist) and Robert Mercer, who for a long time funded Bannon\u2019s pet projects, including alt-right news site Breitbart, and Cambridge Analytica. Here in the UK, Farage is still cosy Mr Brexit. He\u2019s been touring the country running \u201cLeave Means Leave\u201d rallies \u2013 I went to one in a retail park in Bolton \u2013 where talk of medicine running out and lorries backed up on the motorway was denounced as yet more \u201cProject Fear\u201d. He\u2019s the man who holds fast to an ideologically pure  vision untainted by the realpolitik of Theresa May\u2019s compromises. The man who broadcasts live on LBC five times a week and pops up on the BBC.Critically, in Britain, where political coverage follows the beat of Westminster\u2019s drum, we have yet to really catch up with Farage\u2019s uncomfortable new position: in overlapping circles radiating from US special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election.Could this be why Farage is avoiding me? He has refused to answer my questions for more than 18 months, since I wrote a report for the  \u2013 headlined  \u2013 published on 23 April last year. It posed a series of questions to which there are still no clear answers. Questions that, it\u2019s become increasingly clear, cover some of the same territory that Mueller is circling.Farage was caught tripping down the steps of the Ecuadorean embassy by a reporter from BuzzFeed. \u201cNigel Farage just visited the Ecuadorean embassy in London,\u201d the headline said. And the story said: \u201cAsked by BuzzFeed News if he\u2019d been visiting Julian Assange, the former Ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building.\u201dThe visit had come shortly after Farage had visited Donald Trump in Washington. BuzzFeed\u2019s story involved three individuals, Trump, Assange and Farage, who were at the centre of the political storms that had changed the world in 2016 and raised a new set of questions.Last week, 20 months after Farage\u2019s meeting with Assange, LBC issued a statement about it: \u201cIt was an exploratory meeting to discuss the possibility of an interview for the station. This preliminary meeting amounted to nothing, which is why LBC has not previously commented on the context in which the meeting took place as this would not be customary. Whilst Nigel Farage attended the meeting, it was not set up at his instigation.\u201dIt was the timings around the visit that raised questions. Farage left the embassy around noon. BuzzFeed\u2019s story appeared at 1.31pm. At 2.28pm WikiLeaks made an announcement: it would host a live press conference with Assange about his latest leak, . This was during a week when things had started to look serious for Trump. Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s attorney general, had been caught lying under oath about two meetings with the Russian ambassador and  from the Russia inquiry. The \u201cVault 7\u201d story , which landed US tech companies in the middle of CIA cyber-espionage, erupted on to the news cycle. It blew Russia off the front pages.Later, in June 2017, the reported that  to the FBI. Last week Farage told the  he had not spoken to Mueller\u2019s team: \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong, so why would I worry about it? I mean, it\u2019s very funny, deranged.\u201dCaught red-handed.   We don\u2019t know if Farage is involved in the Russian intelligence operation that Mueller is so painstakingly unpicking. The investigation is in lockdown. But we know almost certainly that Assange is involved. An FBI indictment unsealed on 13 July said that at the heart of Russia\u2019s operation to subvert the US presidential election is \u201cOrganization 1\u201d, widely reported to be WikiLeaks.It\u2019s Mueller who\u2019s identified this. It\u2019s the FBI indictments that reveal that so many strands of the investigation run through London.The third time I call Farage at LBC is 1 November 2018, the day Arron Banks is  because the Electoral Commission had decided it can\u2019t be sure of the source of Banks\u2019s multimillion-pound donation to Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign. Or even that it came from Britain.This time I\u2019m \u201cClaire from Ashford, Kent\u201d. I\u2019ve been thinking about Remembrance Sunday, I tell Farage. \u201cIt\u2019s a real time to feel patriotic about our laws and sovereignty,\u201d I say. \u201cIt certainly is,\u201d says Farage. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so concerned about these reports about not knowing where Arron Banks\u2019s money comes from,\u201d I say.\u201cI\u2019m not discussing spending in the referendum here and now, Claire!\u201d says Farage. The line goes dead.Who is Nigel Farage? It\u2019s no longer clear. When I Google \u201cNigel Farage\u201d and \u201cSoros\u201d, I end up watching a video on the far-right conspiracy theory website InfoWars, in which Farage is being interviewed by its founder, Alex Jones. InfoWars Farage is very far from LBC Farage \u2013 even though the video is shot inside LBC\u2019s studio, with the LBC logo behind him. This Farage talks about our shared \u201cJudeo-Christian culture\u201d. (Words not often heard, I can\u2019t help thinking, in West Kent golf club.)This is Steve Bannon\u2019s language. The language of \u201cglobalists\u201d and what Bannon pitches as an all-out war against the \u201celites\u201d, an all-out war he\u2019s now .\u201cFarage has always followed the money,\u201d a Ukip insider, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells me. \u201cHe knows which side his bread is buttered. When the US alt-right and evangelicals started supporting him, he became just like them.\u201d And when I ask Greg Lance-Watkins, another key ex-Ukiper, how he\u2019d describe his ideology he says: \u201cFarage\u2019s ideology is Farage.\u201d In the 90s, Lance-Watkins used to advise Farage before his  appearances. \u201cHe\u2019s scared of the trick question. That\u2019s why he won\u2019t speak to you.\u201cHe\u2019s scared of you, because you confuse him. It\u2019s like the old adage, don\u2019t ask a question you don\u2019t know the answer to. He doesn\u2019t know what answer you\u2019re looking for.\u201dBut then neither do I.It\u2019s not until I sit through  in Melbourne that I realise he\u2019s not just a seven-times failed UK parliamentary candidate, but a bona fide YouTube star. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without YouTube,\u201d Farage tells his audience of young men. Men who, when I ask, what do you think of Nigel Farage, say: \u201cHe\u2019s an absolute legend.\u201d Or: \u201cHe\u2019s the dog\u2019s bollocks.\u201dHow did you come across him, I ask, Alex, a programmer who lives locally? \u201cOn YouTube. I was watching a Jordan Peterson video. He was recommended to me.\u201dIt\u2019s an eye-opening moment. Jordan Peterson is the Canadian psychologist whose forthright views on women and why feminism is wrong have made him an alt-right YouTube breakout star. YouTube\u2019s algorithm had connected him to Farage.I watch the speeches. They have titles like \u201cWho the Hell [sic] You Think You Are? Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces.\u201d And \u201cCan\u2019t Barrage the Farrage [sic].\u201d They\u2019ve been viewed millions upon millions of times.Richard Corbett, the leader of the Labour party in the European parliament, explains how it works. \u201cFarage  and often what he talks about has absolutely nothing to do with what\u2019s being discussed. You think, what\u2019s going on? And then you realise it\u2019s got nothing to do with the parliament. It\u2019s just for his social media output. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t even hang around for the answers. Two minutes later, he\u2019s back on the Eurostar and gone.\u201d (Statistics for voting and attendances show Farage is )It\u2019s these YouTube set-piece speeches, pumped via the site\u2019s algorithm to the phones and laptops of an entirely new generation, that are Farage\u2019s power base now. And, at the centre of this, is RT (formerly Russia Today), the Kremlin-controlled English-language broadcaster. RT made Farage a YouTube star.Much of this story, like Arron Banks\u2019s relationship with the Russian ambassador, is hidden and covert. But there\u2019s also much that is out in the open, like  in the European parliament, and his association with RT.Guillaume Chaslot, an ex-YouTuber who\u2019s now an adviser for the Center for Humane Technology, explains RT\u2019s all-conquering role in the YouTube ecosystem. \u201cThey\u2019re the biggest information network on YouTube. They\u2019ve 22 channels and they have an absolute masterful understanding of how the algorithm works. They make this incredibly effective clickbait content \u2013 disaster videos of the tsunami and so on, and they use it to suck in traffic. And when they have the eyeballs, they use their understanding of the algorithm to send people to political content that supports their foreign policy aims.\u201dRT recognised Farage\u2019s value way back in 2011. An ex-Ukip insider tells me how RT\u2019s London correspondent \u201cpractically lived inside Ukip\u2019s offices. They targeted Gerard Batten first [the current leader of Ukip] and then Farage. They loved it. RT would ask them on every week. They\u2019d talk about anything.\u201d Batten did not respond to the  questions about his relationship with RT.Farage is \u201cphenomenally useful for the Russian government,\u201d Ben Nimmo, a leading researcher into Russian online propaganda, tells me. \u201cThe thing about RT is that they are completely open about what it is.  She has said it\u2019s as much a part of Russia\u2019s arsenal as its ministry of defence.\u201dAll this is out in the open, but the  has been shown emails that reveal something new. The person who used to upload Farage\u2019s videos to YouTube was an EU parliament staffer called Kevin Ellul Bonici. According to a  report last year, sources inside the European parliament said Ellul Bonici \u2013 who did not respond to the allegations \u2013 was \u201ca frequent visitor to the Russian embassy\u201d, after which he would return with \u201ca bootload of propaganda\u201d, and was subject to an internal investigation. The new emails seen by the  show that Bonici was uploading content not just to the official Ukip channel but also uploading it \u201con a private channel\u201d for \u201cthe many fringe websites\u201d.There is no evidence that Farage knew about Ellul Bonici\u2019s alleged relationship with the Russian embassy. When asked about all of the issues in this article, a spokesman for Farage said: \u201cMr Farage has no desire to speak to you under any circumstances.\u201d The Observer could not reach Ellul Bonici for comment.The has also learned new details about a meeting between Nigel Farage and Roger Stone. Stone is the extraordinary peroxide-blond 66-year-old dandy, a self-styled  who\u2019s played a key role in many political scandals since Watergate, and who is central to Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. On 8 August 2016, Stone told a small crowd that he\u2019d been in touch with Assange. There would be a WikiLeaks \u201cOctober surprise\u201d, he suggested, about \u201cthe Clinton foundation\u201d. In later comments he correctly forecast both the source of the leak and the timing of it. It is this claim to have knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 material \u2013 before WikiLeaks released it \u2013 that is believed to have piqued Mueller\u2019s intense interest. Mueller is looking at timings of all this. The timeline of who knew about WikiLeaks\u2019 stash of emails from Democrat accounts, and when. Emails that we now know were hacked by the Russian government and that threw the presidential race into chaos just days before the US presidential election.Stone and his associates have been questioned by Mueller many times. Some of those associates of Stone are Farage\u2019s associates too: InfoWars journalist Jerome Corsi, Steve Bannon and the controversial academic Ted Malloch, once tipped by Farage to be Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU.Stone makes his own appearance in the timeline. One of the film-makers behind the brilliant 2017 documentary , Daniel DiMauro, spoke to me about a meeting that he witnessed between Stone, Alex Jones and Farage during the Republican National Convention, 18-21 July 2016.\u201cStone had arranged to have dinner with Alex Jones and Nigel Farage,\u201d hetells me. And they followed him with the camera crew. \u201cBut we got to the restaurant and Farage\u2019s people were: \u2018No, no, no! You can\u2019t film. You can\u2019t film.\u2019 It was weird. Jones and Stone were totally open to it. But Farage was \u2018No way\u2019. He didn\u2019t want any record of it. We didn\u2019t know what to make of it.Another member of the crew told me: \u201cIt was the first time that Alex Jones, Roger Stone and Nigel Farage met face to face. We\u2019d had a wire on Roger everywhere we went but when we turned up to meet Farage and his guy, he [Farage\u2019s aide] was absolutely adamant.\u201cWhat was so noticeable was how Alex Jones was so pumped up afterwards about the leaks that were coming. He was saying it openly on his show. And then days later, the DNC leaks dropped [on July 22] and blew apart the Democratic National Convention.\u201dLess than two weeks later, on August 4, 2016, Roger Stone would also go on Alex Jones\u2019s radio show and . There would be \u201cproof\u201d of a scandal involving \u201cClinton Foundation\u201d, a new \u201cdevastating\u201d leak. \u201cI think Julian Assange has that proof,\u201d he said.In 2017, a spokesman for Farage told the American magazine : \u201cNigel met Roger Stone in a restaurant in Cleveland during the RNC purely by chance. They subsequently met each other in a hotel in Washington during Trump\u2019s inauguration, again without planning and by chance.\u201dIf you had to pick another extraordinary story about Nigel Farage\u2019s associates, George Cottrell would have to feature. Aged just 22, he was appointed Farage\u2019s aide and Ukip\u2019s chief fundraiser during the Brexit campaign. The two were at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport on 22 July, 2016 \u2013 the day after the Republican convention in Cleveland at which Farage met Jones and Stone. \u2013 who was also there \u2013 describes what happened in his memoir, the : \u201cAs they were alighting from the domestic flight, five FBI officers cuffed him [Cottrell]. They swooped the minute he set foot on the gangway and if Wiggy [Andy Wigmore] hadn\u2019t been standing right behind him, nobody would have known what had happened. All the other passengers were held back. It was swift and discreet, and he was hauled off without explanation.\u201dCottrell was subsequently charged with 21 offences, including money laundering, fraud, blackmail and extortion. He pleaded guilty to one of them and was released after eight months in jail. In an interview with the , he explained how he\u2019d learned about \u201cthe murky and complicated world of \u2018shadow banking\u2019\u201d and had worked for \u201can offshore private bank\u201d that was \u201cunder investigation by the US authorities as a foreign financial institution of primary money-laundering concern\u201d. There is no suggestion in the charges that this was linked to Ukip. Cottrell did not respond to the  attempts to reach him.But the biggest questions are about why  to the Russian embassy in London. In June, the  was shown confidential emails that revealed that Andy Wigmore emailed Cottrell\u2019s legal documents including his federal indictment to his main contact at the embassy, the political secretary, Alexander Udod. (Udod was expelled from Britain in March this year after Sergei Skirpal\u2019s poisoning.)According to Banks\u2019s emails, on 17 August 2016, Banks and Wigmore were inside the Russian embassy, visiting the ambassador Alexander Yakovenko. This was also the day that Bannon took over as Trump\u2019s campaign manager. On 25 August, Farage, Banks and Wigmore travelled to a Trump rally in Mississippi where . The crowd roared. Here was \u201cMr Brexit,\u201d said Trump. The election, he said, would be \u201cBrexit plus, plus, plus.\u201dThe fourth time I call Nigel Farage\u2019s LBC show is just a week ago. Late on Saturday night, the published . An academic from Essex University, Emma Briant, had obtained emails from a Cambridge Analytica employee which revealed that Banks had sought Steve Bannon\u2019s help in soliciting campaign donations from US funders. We have no idea if Banks went ahead and attempted to fundraise in the US. We know only that it would have been illegal for him if he had. Using foreign money in a British election campaign is against the law.But we do know the US \u201calt-right\u201d played a role. On the day that Theresa May triggered article 50, 29 March 2017, a journalist from Breitbart, the rightwing news website cofounded by Steve Bannon, caught Farage with a pint of beer, outside a pub, beaming. He lifts his glass to the camera. \u201cWell done, Bannon. Well done, Breitbart. You helped with this hugely.\u201dIn Britain, Farage is still the man with the pint. The Good Bloke. The kind of man you wouldn\u2019t mind having a drink with. The plucky survivor of both testicular cancer and, on the day of the 2010 general election, . And the press coverage of him \u2013 such as an interview with him in last week\u2019s  \u2013 still trades in Farage cliches. Partly because, as his former colleague Lance-Watkins tells me: \u201cHe is that man. He\u2019s hail-fellow-well-met. He likes people and he has that natural bonhomie. He did so well on because it was a form that was perfectly made for him. But that\u2019s just what\u2019s going on, on the surface. It masks a profound insincerity.\u201dFarage sits at the intersection of the key forces in a new world order. An order that the old formats can\u2019t cope with. What we need to ask is whether a man closely allied to people like Bannon and  should be allowed to amplify his propaganda unchallenged on our broadcast media.It\u2019s the people who have studied the campaign most closely who are asking the most questions. Damian Collins, the Conservative MP leading parliament\u2019s fake news and disinformation inquiry, has said that \u201cthe direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump\u201d urgently need investigating.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to recognise the bigger picture here,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThis is being coordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we haven\u2019t really seen before.\u201dThe committee has called repeatedly for a Mueller-style inquiry. The government continues to ignore it.\u2018What\u2019s your question for Nigel?\u201d the LBC producer asks me when, last Sunday morning, I call in. This time I\u2019m \u201cSarah from Weybridge\u201d, a true-blue voter disgusted with Theresa May\u2019s Brexit betrayal. \u201cI\u2019ll get you straight on,\u201d says the producer. And he does.Actually, I tell Farage, it\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr from the . \u201cOh go away,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, you are a ranting lunatic.\u201dIt\u2019s only later that I notice the date: 18 November. Exactly three years from when Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore launched Leave.EU\u2019s campaign. From when they walked in the door of the Russian embassy and discussed gold and diamond deals. I\u2019m not a ranting lunatic. I\u2019m a journalist. Who\u2019s been trying to ask questions for nearly two years.Nigel Farage declined to answer any questions put to him about subjects raised in this article."},

{"title": "How the singer created a new kind of break up song", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/24/ariana-grande-thank-u-next", "content": "our decades ago, Carly Simon skewered an ex-lover with a song called You\u2019re So Vain. Drawing its power from Simon\u2019s use of the unnamed man\u2019s egotism to take him down a peg, it became a celebrated breakup song.Simon has said the actor Warren Beatty was one inspiration of three \u2013 the other two men remain unnamed. In contrast, in this year\u2019s most popular breakup song, Thank U, Next, we know exactly whom  is singing about. Also singing about more than one ex, she identifies them in the opening lyrics. Unlike Simon, her motive is to praise, not condemn.The song discusses therapper Big Sean, the dancer Ricky Alvarez, the Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson and the rapper Malcolm McCormick, better known as Mac Miller,  after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.Considering those miserable circumstances, Grande sounds surprisingly composed.\u201cI\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 grateful for my ex, thank you, next,\u201d she trills on the chorus. It\u2019s a proclamation that forgiveness is cool and growth is a flauntable quality, perhaps unexpected in an era in which dating apps and hook-up culture have made relationships feel especially disposable.In some ways, Grande embodies that swipe-on attitude \u2013 she sings the lines \u201cOne taught me love / One taught me patience / And one taught me pain / Now, I\u2019m so amazing\u201d with the ease of a hair flip.But the track is more complicated than that. It has a sliver of the dismissiveness of Nancy Sinatra\u2019s These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 or Alanis Morissette\u2019s You Oughta Know, but none of the vengeance. It has the tender sincerity of Carole King\u2019s It\u2019s Too Late but is without that kind of mourning. It is in the spirit of fun female empowerment songs like Gloria Gaynor\u2019s I Will Survive or Cher\u2019s Believe, but with no hint of lingering resentment.Grande praises her exes for the \u201clove\u201d, \u201cpatience\u201d and \u201cpain\u201d that helped make her the \u201camazing\u201d person she is today. In the middle, she teases \u201cI met someone else\u201d, then reveals that someone is herself. The song has a level of resolution and clarity that most people only achieve after a lifetime.Grande lives a life of wealth and public exposure to which few in her age group can relate. In 2017, after a concert at the Manchester Arena, a suicide bomber detonated a bomb. Twenty-three people were killed, 139 wounded. In  posted to Twitter a few days later, Grande expressed her heartbreak, writing: \u201cWe won\u2019t let hate win.\u201dThis September, as she prepared to marry Davidson, news broke of Miller\u2019s death. As thousands mourned the rapper on social media, some blamed Grande for breaking up with him. On 14 September, she posted a tribute , writing: \u201ci adored you from the day i met you when i was nineteen and i always will. i can\u2019t believe you aren\u2019t here anymore.\u201dGrande has also faced very public instances of misogyny and sexism, most notably when she was touched inappropriately by the bishop at the funeral of Aretha Franklin. In every instance, the singer has responded with grace, making positivity an essential part of not only her social media personality, but her brand.When Grande offers words of support, encouragement or gratitude, they do not feel like platitudes born of celebrity-class naivete. Perhaps it\u2019s that consistent earnestness that has made Thank U, Next feel like a powerful cultural moment.Joy and gratitude isn\u2019t always relatable, but from the moment Grande surprise-released the song, the public seemed to identify with her position, streaming the track 55.5m times in the first five days and earning Grande her first No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite trends towards songs that are , it seems audiences are hungry for a tune about boundless, unapologetic positivity. Only an artist like Grande could have pulled it off."},

Is that \u2013 with time plainly running out \u2013 it?Failing some last-minute contributions, May has proved, from an entertainment, news and thus satirical point of view, a dismayingly unco-operative dud of a first spouse. And it\u2019s not as if anyone anticipated amusement up there with Brigitte Macron\u2019s state visit showstoppers, or Samantha Cameron in the fish shop or, earlier, Cherie Blair, in the days when she sized-up property with a conman and shared details of her fertility highs and lows.But there was a reasonable expectation, given recent consort tradition, of Philip\u2019s fashion fails, Philip\u2019s halting confessions about juggling home and career and, at the very least, Philip\u2019s revelations about the big heart pulsing within the Maybot. Think of  to the effect that Gordon Brown\u2019s rages belied a secret tenderness. \u201cThe first time I met him I was struck that someone so intense and so intelligent could be so gentle, could ask so many questions, could really care.\u201dFor his successors, however, Invisible Philip has been good enough to prove that the public routine devised for first spouses is not merely optional but redundant. Somehow, visiting first helpmeets have managed to go shopping without him. Incoming spouses will not \u2013 unless they choose to \u2013 need to agonise, like Mrs Brown and Mrs Blair, about how best to deploy this uncovenanted influence. \u201cI was beginning to realise,\u201d Blair writes in , of an outing in Tokyo, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t simply have to be an appendage on these trips. I was starting to see how I could create a role that would be of real benefit.\u201dThat Blair never quite demonstrated what, beyond top memoir material, these real benefits might be does not mean, as Obama has established, that the consort role cannot be used to good effect. Had she not embraced the position of Flotus, with performative and formal duties that far exceed the UK equivalent\u2019s, we should not, for instance, have her new book, in which the stalling of her own promising career, so that her husband\u2019s could flourish, surely confirms that whatever its sporadic benefits, first ladyship is all wrong. So long, anyway, as it\u2019s unpaid and conceived as principally a range of retro hostess skills, including doting helpmeet, faultless dresser and wise matron, regardless of whether the incumbent is the lawyer Obama who dreams up , or a trophy wife who wears, for a visit to children in a refugee camp, reading: \u201cI really don\u2019t care.

Even without the cultural and political onus on Obama to perform the premier cookie-dough artiste\u2019s job better than it had ever been done before, her natural approach to any task \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll show you\u201d \u2013 ensured that it was she who conferred dignity on the ludicrous position of presidential consort, as opposed to the other way around.But what first ladies can never say is implicit.

But Richard Ratcliffe and Daniela Tejada have built an alliance in adversity based on their shared trauma: the detention of their British spouses abroad.Last week, as , Tejada\u2019s husband, was sentenced to life in a United Arab Emirates prison, Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, immediately got in touch with her to express his solidarity and support.\u201cWe exchanged messages. I just really wanted to say: listen, we\u2019ll be by your side. And good luck. Because it\u2019s really tough, the first few days,\u201d he told the . \u201cYou\u2019re going out, battling for your family on the airwaves, speaking in the way that\u2019s quite raw... You can feel really besieged.\u201dFew will have been able to understand Tejada\u2019s suffering like Ratcliffe, who is continuing a 31-month battle to free his wife from an Iranian jail. The 39-year-old, mother to Gabriella, aged four, has been incarcerated since April 2016 and is serving a five-year sentence.Hedges, 31, has been detained in the United Arab Emirates for more than six months and was sentenced last Wednesday after being convicted, without his lawyer present, in a court hearing that lasted less than five minutes. There are growing hopes that he will be freed in the face of  and a plea for clemency by his family, and that a pardon could come as soon as this week.But for Tejada the wait and uncertainty will be agonising, as Ratcliffe knows only too well.\u201cNaturally Daniela and I have an instinctive understanding of what each other\u2019s going through. We met to share experiences and support each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like people who are in a similar situation to me understand better than others can \u2013 and I think she felt the same as well. We are both in a quite similar place. In some ways it\u2019s the same story.\u201dThe Foreign Office is always very cautious, which can lead to a sense of alienationBoth Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Hedges deny charges of spying for the UK government. Their spouses, who met for the first time last month at a play about Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s imprisonment, have called repeatedly on the Foreign Office to do more to secure the release of their loved ones.Last week Tejada spoke of how the Ratcliffe family had been an inspiration for her \u2013 \u201cjust the strength of their relationship and resilience and how brave they\u2019ve been\u201d, she told Agence France-Presse. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that every sky has a dark cloud that has to pass at some point.\u201dRatcliffe said there was a community of families of innocent British citizens imprisoned abroad, some of whom have been released, that provided support and encouragement for one another. \u201cWe don\u2019t really get to help each other solve any problems but we do get to remind each other that there will be an afterwards, that there\u2019s a life beyond, that we will get through it. People have done that for me and I think that\u2019s an important part of what we can do for each other as families.\u201dHe and Tejada have voiced their frustration at what they say has been a callous lack of consideration from the Foreign Office. Tejada said on Radio 4 last week she had been told the department did not have a duty of care towards Hedges, a PhD candidate at Durham University, while careless  were used against Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. Ratcliffe has been more positive about the treatment of Nazanin\u2019s case by Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s successor, who met Gabriella in Tehran this month.\u201cThe Foreign Office is always very cautious at the beginning and careful about what it shares with families \u2013 which can lead to a sense of alienation. It did in our case,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can end up being quite angry and think that the government is not doing enough. Part of campaigning is always pushing the government forwards.\u201dHe hopes he can use his experience to help Tejada. \u201cCampaigning is a struggle to work out what the right thing to do is, and it\u2019s a struggle to work out how disinterested the advice is that you get. I think that trust is automatically there with other families.\u201dHe offered some insight into how Tejada was feeling: \u201cFor me, the hard bit is when you focus on the sentence, because it sounds such a big, awful and all-encompassing sentence, you know. Certainly five years felt that way. People sat me down to say, \u2018Listen, you have to understand that the sentence doesn\u2019t mean what it says.\u2019 What it means is [the Iranian government] is unhappy and is signalling that. The number\u2019s not relevant.

{"title": "Is it OK to still love boybands as a grown up?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/25/i-used-to-be-normal-is-it-ok-to-still-love-boybands-as-a-grown-up", "content": "ne of the cruellest ironies of the \u201crockist\u201d world is the fact that though the Beatles are the target of anorak-ish obsession by bearded men who look down their noses at the very notion of \u201cpop music\u201d, the Liverpudlian superstars would\u2019ve been nothing without their armies of young female fans.It was the teenaged \u201cBeatlemaniacs\u201d who supercharged a worldwide sensation and spent the money that fuelled the touring that fed the disaffection that led to the albums \u2013 like Revolver, Sgt Pepper\u2019s and The White Album \u2013 that allowed the band to carve out their niche as musical innovators. Tell that to Joe Beatles Fan as he guards his bootlegs like Smaug, however, and you\u2019ll likely be met with a sneer.Happily the delightful new documentary, I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story, ignores what the Beatles became to many and focuses on what boy bands, including others such as One Direction, the Backstreet Boys and Take That, have meant to young women the world over.There\u2019s Elif, a girl in Long Island who pines for \u201cour boys\u201d (One Direction) as she wrestles with the expectations of her Turkish parents. In San Francisco, journalist Sadia maintains her Backstreet Boys fandom even though, in her mid-20s, she worries it\u2019s time to leave it behind. Sydney brand strategist Dara stealthily uses Take That\u2019s music to power her presentations at work. And in Melbourne, TV producer Susan fondly recalls how the Beatles helped her and her family through tough times.Director Jessica Leski and producer Rita Walsh allow these diverse and intergenerational women to weave their own stories. Filmed over five years, their individual narratives swerve in ways you may not initially expect given the upbeat topic of the documentary. Elif\u2019s story is particularly bittersweet.There was a time, during , when I Used to Be Normal looked set to be a far more prosaic look at boyband fandom: one featuring interviews with psychologists and pop culture experts, no doubt discussing just what it is that makes these young women so obsessed with the objects of their passionate affection. Thank god that\u2019s not how it turned out: if you\u2019ve seen one squirming interview with a psychologist about how girls had full-body orgasms at the Beatles\u2019 Shea Stadium show (etc) you\u2019ve seen them all. Stripped of pathologising (or, worse, legitimising) context, this film becomes something far more poetic.In this way, it is quietly (occasionally, explicitly) feminist; the interviewees wrestle with societal and familial expectations, sexuality, and the question of growing up while maintaining a passion firmly believed to be something only teenagers should indulge in. But as Susan says, seeing her Beatlemaniac experience reflected in the 1D mania of 2015, our society is so desperately empty of opportunities for catharsis and where better to let rip than at a boyband show? (Or, as Elif recalls, at the mall during a signing.)Charming animated sequences illustrate the interviewees\u2019 fanciful dreams (some of them literal) about their boyband heroes, including Dara\u2019s teenaged belief that if she learned all the moves of a particular Take That concert VHS tape, she could be called upon to understudy if one of the blokes fell ill or needed the night off.Anyone who has ever loved a band so much it made them cry will see aspects of themselves in the film\u2019s \u201cfangirls\u201d. As a young teen in 1995, AKA the  era, I fell in love with the Beatles for the first time. (If it was painful falling in love with the band when they were only a few years older than you and, thus, potentially your actual boyfriend, I can assure you it was a nightmare to discover them when they were granddads \u2013 or, in John\u2019s case, dead.) When I heard that the local primary school had a badge-making machine set up for its fete, I sprinted to the nearest photocopier and returned to the fete with Fab Four imagery daubed hastily with glitter to make my own Beatles badges for the princely sum of $2 per badge.Sadia draws a line from her teenaged BSB newsletter and website to her journalistic career. I once ran an Angelfire site for Gomez (the non-threateningly boyish English jam band I\u2019m sure were a gateway drug into so-called legitimate music for many boyband fangirls) that led directly to my first published article. It was a fact I used to be mortally embarrassed by, but I Used to Be Normal reassured me. As Dara says, reflecting on the formerly closely held secret of her Take That obsession, \u201cNormal to me sounds boring. It just sounds like there are no big major choruses in that world if you\u2019re normal. And what\u2019s life without a big major chorus?\u201d"},

After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.The opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u00a0\u200bIf May lost\u200b,\u00a0the opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.This is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u00a0The EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u00a0\u00a0day. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The letter has been distributed to the media and published on a new government website.Promising to campaign for the deal with her \u201cheart and soul\u201d before the crucial Commons vote next month, May says Brexit day, on 29 March next year, \u201cmust mark the point when we put aside the labels of \u2018leave\u2019 and \u2018remain\u2019 for good and we come together again as one people\u201d.But as she headed to Brussels on Saturday night for a summit at which the 27 EU leaders are expected to sign off on both the withdrawal agreement and a separate political declaration, outlining the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, senior Conservatives from both the leave and remain wings of her party appeared to be hardening their opposition to her plans and vowing to vote it down.Several former cabinet ministers who served under the prime minister said she would have to go back to Brussels to renegotiate the package, as it would never pass through the Commons in its current form.Speaking at the conference of the Democratic Unionist party in Belfast, which props up May\u2019s government, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become \u201ca satellite state\u201d under May\u2019s plans and called for the backstop agreement, tortuously negotiated as a way to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, to be \u201cjunked\u201d.\u201cIf we are not careful, we are going to stay in the customs union, we are going to stay in the single market, we are going to be rule-takers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cUnless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us \u2013 a satellite state.\u201dThe former Brexit secretary  said he could not vote for the deal, which would leave the UK tied to the EU\u2019s customs union and with no unilateral power to decide when to leave it. May\u2019s deal, he said, had \u201ca near-zero chance of getting through the House of Commons\u201d, adding that the options were now \u201cnew deal or no deal\u201d.May was criticised on Saturday night by Brexiters for agreeing to Spanish demands regarding the future of Gibraltar, after Britain\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, made clear that  would not necessarily be covered by a future trade deal with the EU \u2013 a key demand that they suggest will not now be met by the UK side. Stewart Jackson, former chief of staff to Davis, said the \u201cGibraltar surrender\u201d could end up being \u201cthe straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d. However, May insisted on Saturday night that issues around Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty had not changed and would not change.Strong support for May came from her de facto deputy, the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who warned in an interview with the that failure to back May could have catastrophic consequences. He said if there were a no-deal outcome resulting from MPs voting down the deal, the unity of the United Kingdom would be threatened and a \u201cprofound economic shock\u201d would be triggered. Lidington said that \u201cpart of the political reality\u201d was that \u201cScotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union\u201d.Lidington dismissed alternative plans put forward by Johnson and the prominent Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg for a Canada-style deal that would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK, saying it was not on the table.\u201cThe idea that there is some alternative that was capable of being negotiated is simply not the case,\u201d he insisted. Lidington added: \u201cEvery member of parliament, whichever political party they represent, has got to really think through where the interest of the country lies when we come to the meaningful vote on the deal. A vote against the deal would be a vote to prolong and make worse the uncertainty for business. A vote against the deal would be to put at risk living standards and security of employment and investment in our own country.\u201dAfter  won the reassurances over Gibraltar, the European council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, said he would recommend that the EU approve the deal. \u201cNo one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time the EU27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity,\u201d he said.If the deal is approved by the EU on Sunday, May will spend the next fortnight campaigning for it up and down the country before seeking parliament\u2019s approval, probably in the second week of December.But with Labour and up to 85 Tories saying they are likely to vote against, few see how she can avoid going down to defeat. The former cabinet minister Justine Greening, who backs a second referendum, united with Brexiters in condemning May\u2019s plans. \u201cThis deal fixes nothing but risks everything. It leaves Britain\u2019s economy and the union in a permanently weak position,\u201d Greening said."},

US border officials at some ports of entry have been accepting fewer than 50 asylum requests per day, despite a massive backlog, according to press reports.The arrival and possibly lengthy stay of so many Central Americans in Tijuana prompted the city\u2019s mayor, Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum, to declare a humanitarian crisis, saying resources to support the migrants are scant.The caravans have captured Trump\u2019s attention and anger. He has ominously referred to the mass of impoverished migrants \u2013 who include women and children \u2013 as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and sent soldiers to the border in advance of their arrival.Trump has been seeking to block thousands of Central Americans who are travelling in caravans from entering the US, and has ordered that immigrants who enter the country illegally from Mexico would not be eligible for asylum.

His debut novel from 1962, , has just been reissued by Quercus books after a bidding war, and two further novels are also due to be published.But Kelley, it turns out, was not just a brilliantly experimental novelist but an accomplished photographer. He died last year, aged 79, and his family are currently cataloguing the several thousand negatives he left behind, many of them documenting everyday life in Jamaica, where he and his family lived for nine years in the 1970s. \u201cHe was a serious photographer from the start,\u201d says his daughter. \u201cBut he got a whole lot more serious when he met  in 1968.\u201dAt that time, Cartier-Bresson, who was revered as one of the greatest living photographers, was working on an assignment to document black writers living in Paris. Kelley had relocated there with his family following the assassinations of Malcolm X and Robert Kennedy. When the French photographer turned up at 4 Rue Regis, where the Kelleys lived and where the great American novelist Richard Wright had lived before them, he and William hit it off immediately.\u201cI remember it well,\u201d says Jesi Kelley. \u201cThe house had a real creative atmosphere. My earliest memories are of the smell of the linseed oil my mother used in her paintings and the click of my father\u2019s typewriter. I think Cartier-Bresson picked up on that and he certainly influenced my father\u2019s way of thinking about photography. After that, he always shot full frame on his Pentax and never cropped the results.\u201dKelley photographed many of the creative people who passed through the house, including the American jazz saxophonist, Marion Brown. Jesi Kelley also recalls a visit by the trumpeter Don Cherry, his wife Moki, and her young daughter,  \u2013 \u201cshe had all this energy, even then\u201d.The portraits of artists, writers and musicians that Kelley made in Paris and later in New York, where the family eventually returned, have yet to be catalogued. For now, the photographs he took in inner-city Kingston are the only tantalising glimpse we have of William Kelley\u2019s other creative pursuit.They reveal an eye for candid, often intimately observed documentary pictures of everyday life in the ghettoes of Kingston, the same tenement yards that reggae singers including Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Jacob Miller grew up in and sang about. Jesi Kelley believes that there may be a few shots of Marley somewhere in the archive.\u201cDad\u2019s photographs are important because they show everyday life in those micro-village communities rather than the usual cliched images of poverty and suffering,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in the Bronx. Her mother, Aiki, chimes in: \u201cYou don\u2019t see that poverty if you live in it, which we did for a time. What you experience is a community pulling together \u2013 one fire stove, everyone sharing fish and vegetables and rice. That\u2019s really what he set out to capture.\u201dChildren feature in many of the shots, including an infant girl enveloped in the wreaths of smoke emanating from her father\u2019s chalice (ganja pipe) underneath a hand-painted sign that reads \u201cGod is Good to Us\u201d. \u201cShe had a bad cough,\u201d recalls Aiki Kelley, \u201cso they blow smoke in her face to keep her relaxed and also to help clear up her condition. Ghetto people didn\u2019t trust conventional medicine. They were treating her asthma the natural way \u2013 and it worked.\u201dIn another revealing portrait, an unnamed man sits by a record deck and amplifier in the makeshift bedroom of a house, a beer bottle resting on the table in front of him next to a baby\u2019s bottle. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t see are the giant speakers outside the house, which brought the whole neighbourhood to the party\u201c says Jesi, laughing.What is evident throughout is that Kelley was an unobtrusive photographer, whose quiet images evoke the pulse of day-to-day life in the Kingston ghettoes.\u201cYou have to remember that, back then, not everyone was walking around with a camera in Jamaica,\u201d says Jesi Kelley.\u201cAnd, not everyone was going into the tenement yards. He took his camera everywhere, usually wrapped up in a makeshift bag. They called him \u2018American\u2019, but he was not a typical American. He dressed and acted like everyone else so he was accepted. There is a trust there; these are soulful photographs.\u201dJesi and Aiki plan to eventually exhibit William Melvin Kelley\u2019s Jamaican images back in the country where they were taken and which, for a while, they called home. In the meantime, they will continue to catalogue and print the thousands of negatives from Jamaica, Paris and New York that make up the archive of a uniquely talented individual who, having just become one of the literary sensations of the year, continues to surprise."},

State TV showed footage of medical professionals treating men and women on hospital beds.There was a stench of gas in Aleppo after projectiles were fired, said Rami Abdurrahman, the head of Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Aleppo, the local governor Hussein Diab visited the injured at the hospital and told state TV that 41 people had been admitted. He accused rebels of using poisonous gas in the missiles they lobbed at the Aleppo neighbourhood of al-Khalidiya. Health official Haj Taha later said the number of injured was up to 50, adding that symptoms suggested the gas used was chlorine. Further tests were needed, he said.State TV later said government troops retaliated, hitting the source of the attack. It didn\u2019t elaborate. Rebel commanders and opposition figures discredited the government reports, denying they lobbed gas into Aleppo. The opposition didn\u2019t have chemical weapons or the means to handle them, rebel commander Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razek said. On Twitter, he accused the government of staging the attack to frame the rebels. Rebel spokesman Musafa Sejari said the government was seeking to undermine the ceasefire. Fighting is continuing in various parts of the country. In the north-west, a ceasefire in Aleppo and neighbouring Idlib has been fraying in recent days. On Saturday, Syrian regime shelling killed nine civilians, including seven children, in Idlib province \u2013 the last major rebel bastion in the country. A teacher and four schoolchildren were among the victims after the shelling hit near a school, the Observatory said.Meanwhile, in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, on the Iraqi border, counterattacks by the Islamic State group have killed at least 47 US-backed fighters over two days. The Observatory said the jihadists had launched \u201cthree separate assaults\u201d on Saturday on Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.The fighting on Saturday alone killed 29 SDF fighters, according to the Observatory, while 39 IS fighters were killed over the same period."},

It is claimed they include confidential emails between senior executives, and correspondence with Zuckerberg., the chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, invoked a rare parliamentary mechanism to compel the founder of a US software company, Six4Three, to hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it\u2019s understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn\u2019t hand over the documents.\u201cWe are in uncharted territory,\u201d said Collins, who also chairs an inquiry into fake news. \u201cThis is an unprecedented move but it\u2019s an unprecedented situation. We\u2019ve failed to get answers from  and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest.\u201dThe seizure is the latest move in a bitter battle between the British parliament and the social media giant. The struggle to hold Facebook to account has raised concerns about limits of British authority over international companies that now play a key role in the democratic process.Facebook, which has lost more than $100bn in value since March when the exposed had harvested data from 87m US users, faces another potential PR crisis. It is believed the documents will lay out how user data decisions were made in the years before the Cambridge Analytica breach, including what Zuckerberg and senior executives knew.MPs leading the inquiry into fake news have repeatedly tried to summon Zuckerberg to explain the company\u2019s actions. He has repeatedly refused. Collins said this reluctance to testify, plus misleading testimony from an executive at a hearing in February, had forced MPs to explore other options for gathering information about Facebook operations.\u201cWe have very serious questions for Facebook. It misled us about Russian involvement on the platform. And it has not answered our questions about who knew what, when with regards to the ,\u201d he said.\u201cWe have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.\u201dThe documents seized were obtained during a legal discovery process by Six4Three. It took action against the social media giant after investing $250,000 in an app. Six4Three alleges the cache shows Facebook was not only aware of the implications of its privacy policy, but actively exploited them, intentionally creating andeffectively flagging up the loophole that  used to collect data. That raised the interest of Collins and his committee.A Facebook spokesperson said that Six4Three\u2019s \u201cclaims have no merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously\u201d.The files are subject to an order of a Californian superior court, so cannot be shared or made public, at risk of being found in contempt of court. Because the MPs\u2019 summons was issued in London where parliament has jurisdiction, it is understood the company founder, although a US citizen, had no choice but to comply. It is understood that Six4Three have informed both the court in California and Facebook\u2019s lawyers.Facebook said: \u201cThe materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure. We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.

But what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by the (yellow jackets) movement degenerated rapidly.On one side, protesters reportedly infiltrated by far-right extremists and  (rioters and hooligans) tore up paving stones and hurled them and other missiles at police before building barricades that they set alight. On the other, police used teargas, pepper spray, water cannon and bulldozers to clear the road.Each time the police advanced, protesters rebuilt the barricades, using metal barriers from roadworks and construction sites, rubbish bins and anything else they could find. Many  attempted to withdraw as violence erupted, but were hampered by advancing police. Others retreated, but vowed to remain at the protest. \u201cWe were here as pacifists and we were gassed.

The coalition he put together is clearly strained and he seems incapable of creating consensus.\u201dJust shut the hell up and get on the helicopter. Give us a rest from your crazyJust over a month ago, the landscape looked very different. Trump celebrated the confirmation of his second supreme court justice, a trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the release of an American pastor from prison in Turkey and the lowest unemployment rate for nearly half a century. He was chatting regularly to the media and had rapper Kanye West over to join in the fun. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, confidently  \u201cUnless something terrible happens to the economy, he\u2019ll be re-elected.\u201dBut on 6 November, the American people delivered a reality check. Republicans held the Senate but as the final House results trickle in, Democrats lead by more than 8.6m votes: 53.1% to 45.2%. The party has a net gain of nearly 40 seats,  Ominously, they won in rust belt states that were pivotal to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016.In response, the president has been acting like a man cornered. The catalogue is too long to list in full but here are some of the lowlights:Trump fired Jeff Sessions and hired Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, in what many see as a threat to the special counsel.He tried to ban a CNN correspondent from the White House but lost in court.He skipped a visit to a military cemetery in France.He criticised the admiral who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.He floated bizarre theories for the wildfires in California, twice referred to the destroyed city of Paradise as \u201cPleasure\u201d and revelled in ignorance of climate change.He referred to the Democrat Adam Schiff as \u201cAdam Schitt\u201d.He issued a bewildering statement (633 words with eight exclamation marks) questioning the CIA\u2019s reported conclusion that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.His daughter Ivanka  for government business.He scolded the ninth circuit court of appeals, earning a rare rebuke from the chief justice of the supreme court.It was reported that he wanted the justice department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and former FBI director James Comey.He authorised troops on the US-Mexico border to use \u201clethal force\u201d, despite concerns their presence is a political stunt.And another thing:  raising fears of economic slowdown.It all became so much that on Wednesday, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee,  that Trump should \u201cjust shut the hell up and get on the helicopter. Give us a rest from your crazy. You don\u2019t know the 9th circuit from a circuit breaker. It\u2019s Thanksgiving for crying out loud. Let us be thankful for your silence. You\u2019ve said enough this week.\u201dTrump\u2019s inability to stay silent suggests he has learned nothing from his election drubbing. Other presidents have suffered similar fates in the midterms, only to bounce back and win re-election. But they have done so by making changes and showing humility; when Trump was asked by Fox News to rank himself in the pantheon of great presidents,  when he was asked by a reporter what he was grateful for on Thanksgiving, he talked about himself.Jacobs said: \u201cDisaster has hit the Republican party and everyone but Trump recognises that.  there was a major repositioning and he won in a landslide in 1984. When Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama got hammered in the midterms, there were course corrections. There is no learning curve with Donald Trump. He has shown he is unable to respond to this reality.\u201dThe situation is only likely to darken, Jacobs predicted. \u201cObviously with the investigations starting soon in the House, Trump and  will be able to tarnish Democrats as obstructionist, but if Democrats manage to reveal corruption, it\u2019s going to damage Trump\u2019s claim to drain to swamp. He\u2019s going to look swampy.\u201cThis is an entirely different scenario heading into 2019: the analogy is trench warfare in world war one. The bigger problem across the country is there are not enough Republicans and clearly  and independents in ways we have not seen before. He is very good at mobilising the base but the Republican base is not enough to save him in the presidential election.\u201dAlthough Trump seems to have  Jacobs believes its members will read the runes, especially the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, noted for his ruthlessness. Jeff Flake, the retiring senator from Arizona, has called for Trump to face a primary challenge.If Trump lets the media and Democrats draw him into a negative constant fight over trivia, the election will be closeJacobs said: \u201cI see it getting worse on all these fronts in 2020. Is it inconceivable that [outgoing United Nations ambassador]  would explore a run? I think the conversation is going to move in that direction.\u201dIt has long been speculated that Trump has something to hide: his tax returns, his business dealings, his peculiar devotion to autocrats. Now all are about to be put under the microscope by Schiff and others.There are also signs that Mueller\u2019s investigation could be reaching a critical phase, with Trump having submitted written answers and  centered around WikiLeaks and Roger Stone is imminent. Just because Trump is paranoid doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t out to get him. a political analyst and Republican consultant, said: \u201cDonald Trump seems like he\u2019s worried about two things. First, he\u2019s clearly worried about the Mueller report. If it was purely a question of ego and whether Russia helped him get elected, this is an overreaction. There\u2019s something else going on.\u201cSecond, if you analyse Saudi Arabia and  what Trump says makes no sense. Saudi Arabia is not going to cancel contracts and only has a negligible impact on the cost of oil and gas. Yet Trump promoted the awful cover story. He\u2019s hiding something. There\u2019s something there. He\u2019s not protecting the crown prince; he\u2019s protecting himself.\u201d Trump is the only president in the modern era whose job approval ratings have never been above 50%. Tyler said. \u201cSay what you like about Donald Trump, he has real talents. But he has misused those talents. He could have struck a deal on a big infrastructure package, for example. But he retreated to his base, which only has the potential of shrinking. He keeps the base together by keeping them angry and humans can only stay angry for so long.\u201dTrump\u2019s staunchest supporters are unmoved.  said via email: \u201cReagan was at 35% approval in January 1983. If President Trump goes to a base-broadening strategy, leaving the Democrats to flounder in negativity and fantasy policy ideas, he will win handily. If Trump lets the media and Democrats draw him into a negative constant fight over trivia, the election will be close.\u201d a Fox News analyst and former deputy assistant to Trump, described claims that the president is in a downward spiral as \u201cwishful thinking\u201d and predicted victory in 2020. \u201cCake walk,\u201d he wrote in a series of text messages. \u201cWith liars and loonies like Schiff and Crazy Maxine [Waters] running committees?? Even Dem voters will be driven crazy.\u201dPerhaps. But Democrats are spoiling for a fight.  a political columnist and former congressional spokesperson, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see for the first time in his presidency some substantive pushback from Congress. Democrats will no longer be passively commentating; they will be able to take tangible steps to find out what\u2019s going on in this administration.\u201cStarting in January, Congress has the tools and mechanisms to push more and do more than be outraged. They can hold hearings, get documents, compel testimony. They can get access to the people around the White House and see what they think is going on: are people raising the alarm?\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump fully understands how comprehensive the tools of oversight are for Congress because he\u2019s never had to deal with it. These tentacles go far deeper and far broader than he can know.

But it said Australia and other large countries including the US and China would still \u201cneed to designate new protected areas to improve connectivity\u201d.The UN data also shows that Australia is lagging significantly behind other countries in reporting on how well it is managing protected areas such as national parks.According to the UN,  of Australia\u2019s total protected area estate has assessment measures in place to evaluate how well those places are being managed.\u201cAustralia must lift its game when it comes to protecting habitats for our unique wildlife and ecosystems,\u201d said James Tresize, the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s policy analyst, who is attending the conference in Sharm El Sheikh.\u201cIt has been six years since we\u2019ve had a federal investment program for establishing new national parks. Budget cuts across the board are putting conservation outcomes at risk and management under strain.\u201dMartin Taylor, a conservation scientists at WWF Australia, said protecting key habitats was the most important measure that countries could take to prevent extinctions.\u201cDespite Australia committing to do that 10 years ago, after a brief burst of investment there is now nearly nothing invested in new protected areas,\u201d he said.\u201cTo make matters worse deforestation controls have been axed and forest destruction is again on the rise, putting Australia as the only developed country on the global list of deforestation fronts.\u201dThe UN\u2019s report found that globally 43.2% of ecoregions now meet the target for 17% protection on land, compared with 42.6% in 2016.A spokesperson for the environment and energy department said Australia\u2019s contribution to the targets to date \u201chas resulted in more than 19% of our terrestrial land being under protection, however the department acknowledges that some bioregions remain underrepresented\u201d.\u201cAchieving full ecological representation is challenging, particularly in areas where natural ecosystems are highly fragmented or where land is not available,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u201cThe department is working with reserve partners to explore alternative approaches for achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes in underrepresented bioregions.\u201dThe spokesperson said national reports on steps taken to implement the Convention on Biological Diversity and their effectiveness were an international obligation and a submission was made every four years.\u201cThe next report is due at the end of 2018,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the department was also working with managers of protected areas to improve data collection."},

He also linked it to his forthcoming drought summit.But the Guardian Australia can reveal that \u2018bring flavour to Bland\u2019 was in fact a campaign cooked up by the advertising agency Taboo for Goose Island \u2013 the idea being to create a viral plea to bring \u2018flavour to Bland\u2019 and then ride to the rescue with their beer.When Morrison was told the Bland slogan was in fact part of an advertisement for the beer, he agreed to go along with it.A spokeswoman for the Goose Island Beer Company, which is owned by US brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAfter the PM\u2019s video was put out, his office was advised that the Bland campaign was part of an advertising campaign, which included Goose Island. It was a fun, light-hearted campaign that Bland was very pleased to be part of.\u201dA spokesman for Morrison said the prime minister continued to support the campaign after being told Goose Island was behind it, because Bland was a real shire and it was a good promotion for the area.\u201cThe prime minister wanted to support Bland Shire because like many regional communities, they have been trying everything to attract people to the area to combat the effects of drought on local farmers and businesses,\u201d a spokesman said.The saga began when Morrison saw a Ray Smith, calling for people \u201cto send us anything that\u2019s going to add to the flavour of Bland\u201d. Smith tweeted it with a personal video message and the hashtag #BringFlavourToBland.Morrison responded, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got a great curry recipe and I\u2019m going to be bringing you the curry. But more important than that here at the drought summit today I announced a million dollars that\u2019s going to a whole bunch of new drought-affected councils and that includes Bland. So I\u2019ll be bringing you a million bucks as well.\u201dI've heard 's message from Bland Shire Council: And I've got a message for them.  Despite by now knowing about the beer commercial link Morrison made good on his word and sent the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, to visit the shire and deliver his Sri Lankan curry recipe personally on 16 November. It was cooked up for the Bland Flavour Festival the following day in West Wyalong, a town in the shire. will prove there\u2019s nothing bland about it when it hosts the  tomorrow.As part of my Acting PM duties, I personally delivered PM \u2019s Sri Lankan curry recipe to Bland GM, Ray Smith & Mayor Brian Monaghan \ud83c\udf36 The Taboo campaign director James Mackinnon initially told Guardian Australia Ray\u2019s videos were \u201cso well done\u201d and \u201cwe answered the call of the Bland Shire\u201d and decided to put on a big party serving Goose Beer because \u201cthey\u2019re having a rough time at the moment\u201d.Well Australia, I think we did it. Bland is now the official home of flavour! A huge thank you to everyone who came down, danced, ate, laughed and knocked the top off some . Looking forward to some leftover  curry!    He later admitted he had produced the video for Smith.\u201cScott Morrison coming out was not part of our plan so it was kind of a fortunate thing that everyone loved Ray so much,\u201d Mackinnon said.\u201cOur client, Goose Island, when that happened, they went into panic mode and they called the prime minister\u2019s office and said in full transparency that we are working with the shire on this. It\u2019s all absolutely true. Ray is not an actor. We actually just told a factual story about a town that is lacking in flavour because of its geography.\u201dA PR firm for Goose Island confirmed Taboo made the original video and the whole affair was an advertising campaign.History in the making. The very first  Bland Flavour Festival is about to kick off! If you want to know  curry tastes like, I\u2019d get down to the Royal Hotel! McCormack defended his participation in the campaign on the basis that it benefited the drought-affected region.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to hear last weekend\u2019s Bland Flavour Festival was a huge success,\u201d McCormack told Guardian Australia.\u201cIt attracted hundreds of visitors to the drought-affected town of West Wyalong and proved there\u2019s nothing \u2018bland\u2019 at all about the Bland shire.\u201cMore than 300 bowls of the prime minister\u2019s famous Sri Lankan curry were served up and I hear everyone loved it!\u201cIt\u2019s events such as the Bland Flavour Festival which bring a community together and give a welcome boost to local businesses to help them pull through this tough time.\u201cI support all events which encourage people to visit and spend money in regional communities. They need it now more than ever.\u201dMany media outlets, including the ABC and Ten\u2019s The Project, also treated the campaign as a genuine promotion by the shire.The people of Bland say they're far from Dull and Boring \u2014 the Scottish village of Dull & the US town of Boring that is \u2014 and now they're looking to  with the launch a video that's quickly gained media & 's attention:  \u201cMr Smith said the council had made the video in the hope of attracting new visitors and businesses,\u201d the ABC reported.Ray Smith making a \u201cPho Pas\u201d in his pronunciation of Pho, but we\u2019ll forgive him after his brilliant tourism video for the Shire of Bland  Smith told Ten Daily the offer was \u201cextremely serious\u201d and The Project\u2019s Waleed Aly interviewed Smith on the show without mentioning the involvement of the beer company."},

If we take , it suggests two things \u2013 the national political contest is narrowing, and the real opponent for both Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten in the coming federal election is voter disaffection.I\u2019m not sure yet if the contest is narrowing. We need more field evidence. But the mail is in on disaffection, and has been for some time. In late 2016,  showed satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and loyalty to major parties had hit record lows among Australian voters, with party leaders suffering sustained falls in popularity unlike any other period in recent history. of 2017, more than half the survey said it had been a particularly bad year for Australian politics (and this was well before the Liberals third leadership change in two terms), and there was strong support for integrity measures, like donations reform, always a neat proxy for drain the swamp.Tracking back to this week\u2019s poll, there\u2019s burgeoning interest in voting for independents, with 42% of the sample flirting with that idea. The cohort tempted to vote independent in 2018 remain engaged with politics, they haven\u2019t switched off, but more than 70% of them think neither Labor nor the Liberals have a long-term plan for the country.Teasing out these trends provides a clearer sense of the terrain major party leaders are jousting on right now. They are fighting not just each other, but voter fatigue and disillusionment, which adds another layer of difficulty.With this backdrop in mind, it\u2019s interesting to chart Scott Morrison\u2019s trajectory since taking the prime ministership in late August. . The new prime minister said he would bring the Liberal party, the parliament, and the country back together. That reassured colleagues who had rallied for Morrison largely to hold out Peter Dutton.Almost three months down the track, Morrison is tracking into less uplifting territory, and Dutton, who made himself scarce briefly after the ugly palace intrigues in August, is also back in the centre of the political action.Elements of Dutton\u2019s preferred playbook have come to the fore. The government is signalling it will wind back the level of immigration, something the home affairs minister has advocated for months, and it\u2019s being tough on terrorists .Dutton, just for the record, has been trying to push the citizenship-stripping envelope , when ministers came to rhetorical blows around the cabinet table about a proposal he pushed, with Tony Abbott\u2019s support, that the immigration minister be given extraordinary powers to strip an Australian of their sole citizenship.The sum of the parts tells us this: the government is searching for an electrification point, something to connect it to voters less inclined to listen. It\u2019s picking fights with Labor to try and amplify that effort. Dutton right at the moment is chasing Labor down the road, , or rebuff a national security proposal, allowing him to paint them as the lily-livered villains in his graphic novel.The Coalition is in something of a quandary. They can\u2019t govern, at least not really, given  post Wentworth, so they must campaign. They can\u2019t campaign on their record, because there is no compelling record to run on, because the Coalition has no settled identity with the public.Morrison is going flat out to try and build up initiatives to campaign on, in fact too flat out at the moment to knit the ideas into any kind of coherent framework, so for the public right now, looking on at the government, the only real constancy over two terms has been division and infighting.One way to grab the contest by the throat would be a clarion local expression of the sovereignty-first populism now finding grim articulation in rightwing politics around the world \u2013 which is what , and a majority in the Liberal party stepped back from in late August.We\u2019ve been lucky in Australia, at least, comparatively. Pauline Hanson likes to think she\u2019s good at that corrosive shtick, but she isn\u2019t really. After more than 20 years in the game, the One Nation leader remains more fringe figure rather than a genuine change agent.We haven\u2019t really had a political leader capable of mainstreaming nativism in the way Donald Trump has in America; a leader who can prosper by turning things deeply toxic, who can  as Frank Underwood says in a Brechtian moment in the political melodrama, House of Cards.So are we on the brink of that now?It\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m really not sure, partly because I don\u2019t think the prime minister has yet determined how far he\u2019ll wade into whatever it takes territory. Morrison is always a difficult political figure to capture, because he\u2019s always in flight.The other relevant factor here is Labor\u2019s capacity to shut down any  attempt at Trumpesque electrification by matching whatever is on the table, which is the posture they\u2019ve adopted with national security. You want to cut immigration? Cool. So do we. Let\u2019s move on.If you speak to government MPs in Sydney, and to a lesser extent Melbourne, they tell you immigration is white hot at the moment, not so much as an issue in itself, but as a proxy for voter frustration about over-development, and suboptimal city infrastructure, which fuels the disaffection I referenced at the opening of the column. It has become a potent symbol of governments not working, not delivering.Before coming to the prime ministership, Morrison attempted to reason with the prevailing sentiment by arguing forcefully that the answer lay in investing more in \u201ccongestion-busting\u201d infrastructure, not in cutting the cap.He\u2019s switched lanes now, in search of that elusive connection point with voters, the point that says I get it, I\u2019m listening.But the prime minister is also, thus far at least, approaching the tinderbox judiciously. One litmus test of that is the speech Morrison delivered this week telegraphing the cut in migration.If you take the time to , and it\u2019s worthwhile reading it, the proposed cut was cloaked inside a robust defence of immigration and the benefits it brings to Australia.If we summarise the pitch, it was this: I need to hit pause for a bit because people in Sydney and Melbourne are ropable about population outstripping serviceable infrastructure, and I have to make a conciliatory gesture to them, otherwise the casualty might be public support for immigration in a country that really needs immigration to deal with the challenges of an ageing population.Dutton or Tony Abbott, who has shape shifted in recent times from Austerity Tony to , would have packaged that message quite differently, which suggests to me there\u2019s still a line there to hold.The question is, will Morrison continue to hold it, or jump lightly over it?"},

That is what really makes people angry,\u201d Andrews told the Nine Network on Sunday.\u201cThey want politicians who say what they are going to do, and then get on and do it. Where that leaves (the prime minister Scott) Morrison I leave it for you to judge.\u201dOn day one of term two, Andrews did the rounds on breakfast television, championing his \u201cpositive and optimistic plan\u201d for the state and decrying the Liberal-Nationals\u2019 attempts to \u201cscare\u201d their way into power.Victorian  with as many as 16 more seats following the ballot result that shocked even the winners.As of Sunday morning, about 71 per cent of lower house ballots had been counted and Labor grabbed 52 seats, with another 10 in doubt.The Coalition lost half of its seats and calls were being made for senior  figures to resign. The opposition leader Matthew Guy conceded defeat.The Coalition vote also collapsed in electorates traditionally held by conservatives, including in eastern suburbs such as Ringwood, where there was a swing toward Labor of more than 9%, and the blue-ribbon Hawthorn, held by the shadow attorney general, John Pessuto, but under threat of falling to Labor.\u201cWe did a lot of things right but obviously something has gone horribly wrong,\u201d Pessuto said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to clearly have to do a root and branch review. We shouldn\u2019t be in this position.\u201dThe result makes Andrews the first premier to win a second term since Steve Bracks in 2006. An alleged terrorist attack in the city just one fortnight before the election fuelled the Coalition\u2019s law and order campaign, but this failed to sway voters and appears to have worked against them. The ABC psephologist Antony Green had called victory for Labor by 7.20pm.Andrews told party faithful at  headquarters in Mulgrave that Labor was \u201cthe most progressive government in the nation\u201d and that voters had \u201cin record numbers rejected the low road of fear and division\u201d.\u201cAnd for that, I am very, very proud.\u201dThe federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said Victorians had \u201ccomprehensively\u201d rejected the tough-on-crime messaging of the Coalition, which he said had the potential to \u201cdivide the Australian community\u201d and \u201cattack\u201d multiculturalism.\u201cI thought the Victorian community said very loudly and clearly: \u2018We reject a campaign based on fear and division\u2019,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cI want to congratulate Daniel Andrews and the Labor party.\u201dBut the Greens were headed towards a disappointing result, with Brunswick on a knife-edge despite the party running a comprehensive campaign there and predictions they would gain they seat. The party was also projected to lose Northcote and in difficulty in their seat of Prahran. Albert Park and Richmond, also seats where the Greens had hoped to make gains, were seeing swings towards Labor. The party\u2019s hopes of forming minority government were dashed.While analysts focused on critical bellwether seats like on the Frankston line like Bentleigh, Mordialloc, Carrum and Frankston, all won by the party forming government at the last four elections, the swing against the Liberal party in seats believed to be safe was unprecedented. In the very safe seat of Box Hill in the east, for example, there was a 14% swing towards Labor. In Ferntree Gully, held by the Liberals by 7.7%, there was an 8.7% swing against the Liberals by the time 21.7% of the vote was counted. The Liberals held the affluent bayside electorate of Brighton by 9.7% at the last election but by 10pm the 19-year-old Labor candidate, Declan Martin, was only marginally behind.There were shouts of joy and chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d in Mulgrave as more seats kept falling Labor\u2019s way. Statewide, Labor saw a swing towards it of about 6%. The Coalition was projected to hold just 17 seats at most.About those who today could not see their way clear to support our positive and optimistic plan \u2026 we will still govern for you, we will govern for all Victorians,\u201d Andrews said in Mulgrave. \u201cWe will make sure that regardless of how you voted, we will have better schools, we will have better hospitals, we will build the infrastructure we need and create the jobs that are so important.\u201dThe leadership spill three months ago, which saw Malcolm Turnbull, popular in parts of Victoria, replaced by Scott Morrison, had an impact. Federal politics played a part in the Coalition bloodbath, the shadow education minister, Tim Smith, said.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got federal politicians talking about themselves and their various ambitions, that hasn\u2019t helped our party like it didn\u2019t help Labor during the Rudd Gillard years,\u201d he said.In his concession speech the Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, said his party had campaigned on issues \u201cof the most importance to Victorians\u201d.\u201cTonight is clearly not our night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that. We acknowledge that. We accept that.\u201d Immediately after his short speech Guy left the stage and shut himself in an administration office, while his colleagues cleared out of the venue at the Veneto Club in Bulleen by 9.30pm. Guy left the venue without giving interviews.The former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett called on the Liberal party state president, Michael Kroger, to resign.\u201cMichael, if you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s 8.20pm \u2013 by midnight, I hope your resignation is on the floor,\u201d Kennett told Seven News.As the night went on there were also signs of possible upsets in the regions, somewhat overshadowed by Labor\u2019s overwhelming victory. Cathy McGowan-endorsed independent Jacqui Hawkins remains in with a shot in Benambra in Victoria\u2019s north-east, while Ali Cupper is also a chance of nabbing Mildura from the Nationals."},

And what did Livingstone do about it? She didn\u2019t bother disclosing the incident in CBA\u2019s recent remuneration report, so shareholders were kept in the dark.Senior counsel assisting the royal commission, Rowena Orr QC, asked Livingstone why she didn\u2019t share the information with shareholders.Livingstone replied: \u201cBecause the former chair did not agree to return any of his fees.\u201dOrr said: \u201cCould I ask you to consider now whether that\u2019s a message that you think should be sent publicly, that you made a decision as a board to request the former chair to return 40% of his fees?\u201dLivingstone replied: \u201cIn retrospect, yes, perhaps we should have made that public.\u201dIt was telling that a professional like Livingstone didn\u2019t feel the need to be transparent with shareholders about significant developments inside her boardroom.Other evidence revealed repeated management failures at the bank, including that senior executives ignored warnings about excessive mortgage broker commissions, mis-selling of insurance products and compliance requirements.In his evidence to the commission this week, CBA\u2019s chief executive, Matt Comyn,  but it was very hard to do so.This, remember, is Australia\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation, one that has made billions of dollars in profits in recent years and has paid fat dividends to its shareholders.But it\u2019s not just CBA. (Australia\u2019s third biggest company) and NAB, and deep-seated problems have been revealed about the way Australians buy financial advice, insurance and superannuation.It has taken a royal commission to expose the issues behind the scandal, which should have been sorted out long ago by the industry\u2019s highly paid executives and regulators.But, as Comyn\u2019s evidence showed this week, perhaps the biggest scandal is that everyone knew a long time ago that management standards were poor.One story from 2016 is very telling. Back then the Turnbull government was fighting very hard to force all superannuation funds to appoint more independent directors in an effort to stymie union power on industry super boards. In late November that year, a forum was held in a theatre in Parliament House attended by representatives from the super industry, particularly industry super funds. Many of them had travelled from overseas for the occasion. Serious people. The type of people who invest billions of dollars in big infrastructure projects globally, and know how to handle money.The Liberal MP Kelly O\u2019Dwyer delivered a speech that was a textbook example of misreading an audience.She told them superannuation funds \u2013 and by that she meant industry funds \u2013 were not governed to the same standard as major banks and life insurance companies. It drew laughter from the crowd.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d one audience member said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to be joking,\u201d said another.Peter Collins, who was a former leader of the NSW Liberal party and who had subsequently worked in the industry fund sector, told Guardian Australia that O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s comments were laughable.\u201cIf super funds had been responsible for systemic failures in financial advice, failure to pass on interest rate cuts, excessive executive remuneration and other forms of profit gouging by banks, there would have been a royal commission into super funds in a flash,\u201d he said at the time.\u201cIt is abhorrent and unacceptable in the minds of most Australians that the standards for super funds should be the same as those tolerated for the banks.\u201d"},

It is such a well-worn tactic by conservative parties around the world that of course it is the one which a party led by Scott Morrison would pursue.The current prime minister is like an advertising executive you go to see if you want your product marketed in a way that was successfully done by someone else four years ago.And so we have fear of negative gearing, fear of power prices and power blackouts, fear that your retirement income is about to be raided and fear of migration and Islamic terrorists.Taking a page out of Donald Trump\u2019s book (as pretty much he does like a reflex now), Morrison decided that the real problem of terrorism was that it was not being called out as \u201cextremist radical Islam\u201d. So he  and had a bit of a rant about the need for Muslim leaders to do more to stop terrorism.And I get it. Terrorism scares people and there is no doubt there are those within our nation who would do us harm for ideological purposes. But the marvel of terrorism is that the message is always the same \u2013 we need to be fearful and we need to give the police more powers which strip away our privacy.A  in a tragic event in Melbourne? We need access to encrypted messages. Police  in Melbourne? We need access to encrypted messages.So logic-free has the debate become that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, argues the ALP  to allow access to encrypted messages because they have not come out in support of it. And yet that legislation is currently before a parliamentary committee investigating its worth. Yes now the government expects the opposition to support something before it is even reviewed.Add in the mix the fear that migrants are ruining our cities with the .The shift to fear often reveals a few holes in one\u2019s argument. Morrison is now contradicting his own views from earlier this year, when he rubbished Tony Abbott\u2019s call for a cut to permanent migration saying \u201cit\u2019s very hard to look at the data and see that that\u2019s actually the problem\u201d.But that was then, now there\u2019s an election to win. Though the reality is the worth of such a tactic is rather limited.Morrison (and others in the LNP) might do well to ponder the impact Trump has actually had on the Republican party\u2019s electoral fortunes in the recent midterm elections.Take Orange county in California. This wealthy area \u2013  \u2013 has long been staunchly Republican, and was the birthplace of Richard Nixon and political home of Ronald Reagan. In the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections just two of the six districts within Orange county voted Democratic. In  earlier this month, all districts voted Democratic.Yes there have been , but not that drastic. Rather it reminds one more of the Wentworth byelection.At that election voters were clearly annoyed by the dull populism pursued by Morrison. Rather wonderfully,  at the time reported one voter saying with exasperation: \u201cNext thing you know he\u2019ll be blaming refugees for the traffic on Bondi Road.\u201dAnd so the fear ranges from migration and terror and also into economics. Here the chair of the economics committee, Tim Wilson, is keen to help out.This week on Sky he laughably compared the prime minister\u2019s call for Muslim clerics to address the problems of terrorism with the call for Christian churches to respond to the issues of abuse that were found in the recent royal commission.Of course in that case the crimes were by employees of the churches and with often tacit knowledge of the churches\u2019 executives. No one is suggesting the alleged terrorists are actually Muslim clerics.But logic, who needs it? Certainly not anyone who came out of the libertarian romper room that is the Institute of Public Affairs, as did Tim Wilson.Wilson as chair of the House economics committee normally would be investigating government legislation or perhaps broader economic issues such as competition, instead he is currently chairing  into the ALP\u2019s policy on removing refundable franking credits.One would think a libertarian might believe such a partisan review should be funded by the Liberal party itself, but of course like a good libertarian, Wilson seems only too eager to run to the bosom of a , and then to set about wasting public funds.And so we have a government-funded inquiry into an ALP policy, which has mostly become a whinge-fest for self-funded retirees, who seem unable to appreciate that there is a public cost to a system which allows people to reduce their tax, and in this case ensures those who pay do not receive a rebate.We should recall  \u2013 not long after John Howard also made negative gearing . So the policy is not altering something that has been around forever.And let\u2019s not pretend this will hit low-income earners the most. It will certainly hit those with a low \u201ctaxable income\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point. But this week, the  into dividend imputation credit refunds. It found that 82% of all excess franking credits claimed went to the largest 30% of all self\u2010managed superannuation funds, and more than half \u2013 $1,366.2m was claimed by the top 10% alone. we also discovered the real cost of tax minimisation and tax cuts. The latest data from  found how important health and education spending was in reducing inequality.But the importance is not just linked to income levels \u2013 age is also a massive factor.Households headed by those over 65 account for 23% of the population but they receive 38% of health social transfers \u2013 things such as the PBS and public health services.And while for the rest of the population these health transfers are worth 8% of their average disposable income, for over 65s they are worth 26% of their income.Tax cuts and engendering a system that encourages tax minimisation has costs, and those who can end up harmed the most are those who suggest they \u201cself-funded\u201d. Public services are vital for older people, and their importance will only increase as people\u2019s longevity increases.We need to worry about policies that would inevitably see those services cut and would see people in need worse off. And that is something truly to be afraid of. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},

In this age of echo chambers and filter bubbles, it is, many insist, better to settle a question than to debate it, better to be certain that one is right than to risk being proved wrong.On perhaps no issue has the question of what can or cannot be debated been more sharply contested than that of . How should society, and the law, look upon people who were born male but see themselves as female? Trying to answer that question has led to bitter confrontations between trans activists, determined to secure full rights for trans people, and \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists worried that the notion of what it is to be a woman is being transformed to the detriment of women\u2019s rights.In Britain, the government\u2019s consultation on proposed changes to the  ended last month. At its heart was the question of whether trans people can decide for themselves what should be their legally defined gender.For trans people, the freedom to define themselves is vital. To question, , whether a trans woman is \u201creally a woman\u201d is, activists insist, to threaten the individual\u2019s identity. It does irreparable harm by subjecting trans people to mental trauma and giving succour to violent bigots. \u201cI deeply resent the idea that my identity gets to be \u2018debated\u2019 in the first place,\u201d wrote the American activist Jennifer Finney Boylan.In this age of echo chambers, it is, many insist, better to be certain that one is right than to risk being proved wrongMany feminists insist, however, that there is a difference between acknowledging that trans women see themselves as female and counting them as women in a legal or social sense. To accept the trans viewpoint, argues the philosopher Kathleen Stock, is to view female biology and reproduction as only \u201ccontingent features of womanhood\u201d. Yet, for most natal women, \u201cit\u2019s central to their sense of self-identity\u201d that \u201cthey have a female body\u201d. Feminists object, too, to the idea that someone who may be biologically male but self-identifies as a woman should be allowed into female-only spaces, whether changing rooms or women\u2019s prisons.There are reasonable arguments on both sides of the debate. There are also unreasonable arguments on both sides. That\u2019s what makes it a difficult issue. Simply saying this, however, is itself taken by many to be transphobic. It is bigotry, trans activists insist, to question the validity of self-identification or to object to trans women being allowed into women-only spaces. is a feminist group dedicated to defending the idea of women-only spaces. Its meetings have been disrupted by protesters and banned by local councils as \u201cproviding a platform for hate speech\u201d. When another feminist group, Liverpool ReSisters, put up stickers proclaiming  on Anthony Gormley statues on Crosby beach, they were investigated by the police for possible hate crimes and condemned by the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, for their \u201chateful\u201d actions.The Canadian feminist Meghan Murphy recently tweeted \u201cmen aren\u2019t women\u201d and asked: \u201cWhat is the difference between a man and a trans woman?\u201d Twitter shut down her account for \u201cviolating our rules against hateful conduct\u201d and forced her to delete her tweets.The issue is not whether Stock or Murphy or the ReSisters are right in their views. I agree with some of their arguments, disagree with others. The issue, rather, is whether it is valid for them to raise the issues they do or whether the very act of doing so constitutes \u201chatred\u201d.If it is \u201chate speech\u201d to question a particular definition of what it is to be a woman, or \u201cbigoted\u201d to express concern about non-natal women being allowed into female-only spaces, the very notion of public debate is transformed. There would seem to be little one could say on most difficult issues that could not also be construed as hatred.To suggest that the kinds of questions posed by Stock or Murphy should not be asked is to suggest, contra Joubert, that it is better to settle questions than debate them. The trouble is, questions are rarely settled without debate. Stock and Murphy raise certain issues not because they are bigots but because of the realities facing women in society. Whatever one thinks of their arguments, these realities will not disappear simply by labelling critical feminists \u201chatemongers\u201d.All it does is to cheapen the meaning of hatred, making life easier for the real bigots and to eviscerate public debate.

Two years, after all, is a long time for anyone to be banished from their work. Was it time to fight back? If he felt unfairly maligned, did he want to explain why? And because the subject matter was never going to make it an easy conversation, would he confront all the issues that \u2013 whether he liked it or not \u2013 made him such a prominent figure in the Barry Bennell scandal?There are, after all, so many unanswered questions for the man whose 35-year association with  incorporates more than 1,200 games as manager, plus spells as managing director and, latterly, technical director. Did he, I asked, want to challenge the information that has been passed to the FA\u2019s independent inquiry that he was once so protective of Bennell, even writing a character reference before his colleague\u2019s first criminal trial, because in the opinion of one key witness, \u201cmy feeling is that Barry Bennell had something on Dario\u201d? Was this the time, two years in, to address the other damaging revelations that have cropped up since Andy Woodward\u2019s interview in the began what the FA\u2019s chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis in the history of the sport?It probably was not a surprise that he turned down the offer, having taken legal advice, and the message came back that he did not think it was appropriate to comment. Solicitors rarely advise their clients to engage directly with journalists and that means we will have to rely on Gradi\u2019s previous statements in which he has emphasised there has been no wrongdoing on his part. \u201cThe club are in the process of a review,\u201d one concluded, \u201cand I won\u2019t be making any further comment until this is finalised.\u201dThe problem is that was 24 November 2016 and Crewe have now abandoned that investigation while, in the meantime, there have been two criminal trials involving their former employees, with a third possible next year, and the FA is well into its own inquiry, meaning all sorts of new detail and unanswered claims involving Gradi and his colleagues, what they knew and what they did about it. One allegation that has been put to the official inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, is that Crewe were aware Bennell was in a relationship with an under-age girl. Crewe have told this newspaper they are not going to comment publicly in response.Bennell is now serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of 50 specimen charges relating to boys from the junior setups of Crewe and Manchester City, his previous club, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. At least 86 others \u2013 a figure not updated since January \u2013 have reported him to the police and the man who was described in court as a \u201cchild molester on an industrial scale\u201d, imprisoned now for the fourth time, faces the prospect of another major trial next year, involving nine complainants. That has delayed the FA\u2019s inquiry and means it could be 2020 before the governing body decides whether Gradi, now 77, should ever be allowed to return to the sport.Gradi had modified his own house to accommodate boys. Indeed, he needed a people carrier to ferry them aroundPerhaps more will become clear when Chelsea publish the results of their own independent inquiry into the crimes of Eddie Heath, taking in the specific allegation that Gradi visited the parents of a 15-year\u2011old Chelsea youth-team player to \u201csmooth over\u201d one complaint of sexual assault against the club\u2019s former chief scout. That, after all, appears to have been the story that compelled the FA to remove Gradi from the sport. Gradi was Chelsea\u2019s assistant manager at the time, in his early 30s, and is said to have told the victim\u2019s family that he knew Heath was \u201ccloser\u201d to boys than he should have been.Did Gradi suspect the same of Bennell? And, perhaps more pertinently, if not, why not? Gradi, the inquiry has been told, was so protective of Bennell he allegedly flew into a temper when he was informed, according to one account, that Crewe\u2019s directors wanted to stop the club\u2019s youth-team coach taking boys home to stay overnight. Gradi, like Bennell, kept bunk beds at home to accommodate Crewe\u2019s academy players. \u201cWhat are you going to do about me, then?\u201d Gradi is said to have asked the chairman, John Bowler. \u201cI take kids home.\u201d That, allegedly, was the key intervention, meaning Bennell was free to continue preying on boys at the house where he kept a monkey, a wild cat, a juke box, games machines and other attractions.Gradi, then the first-team manager, had modified his own house to accommodate boys. Indeed, he needed a people carrier to ferry them all around and, although this is far from an easy subject to address, it has been made clear to the people leading this case why so much innuendo and suspicion has followed him throughout his professional life. \u201cYou\u2019d always see him with his arm around a blond boy,\u201d one former Crewe academy player has told the inquiry. \u201cHe used to prefer blond boys. He had dressing gowns with the [boys\u2019] initials on. He had a [swimming] pool that was built so it was a certain level for young boys to play in.\u201d Gradi used to take boys on holidays and, it is claimed, had to be talked out of resigning after one game because of some pointed barracking from a number of Crewe fans behind his dugout.The inquiry, I have discovered, has been asked to consider why a manager of Gradi\u2019s achievements did not attract more offers from higher in the sport. One former schoolboy footballer, then 14, has reportedly given a statement to an FA safeguarding officer to allege that Gradi showed him \u2013 one of the \u201cchosen ones\u201d \u2013 a pornographic movie and invited him to go away skiing. Plus there is separate evidence from Bennell\u2019s victims that seriously undermines the claim that nobody in authority at Gresty Road had grave concerns about the coach and talent\u2011spotter who was described during one court appearance as having \u201calmost an insatiable appetite\u201d for prepubescent boys.One says Crewe were known by opponents the length and breadth of the country as \u201cthat paedophile club\u201d. Another can recall Bennell\u2019s appearance on the touchline leading to confrontations with parents and opposition coaches. One former player has told the inquiry: \u201cWhenever we used to play away at, say, Manchester United, everybody used to talk about it: \u2018Oh, Crewe kids are abused.\u2019 But within the club \u2026 I talk about it as a ring fence. The ring fence was so tight within that community club that, no matter what other people said, they just carried on. It was so open.\u201dIf any of this sounds lopsided, it is important to reiterate that Gradi has had frequent opportunities to explain, in detail, his closeness with Bennell, once a youth-team player at Chelsea, and confront all the relevant questions. Crewe have also chosen not to comment and it is not clear what, if anything, Gradi and the 81-year-old Bowler have told Sheldon\u2019s inquiry. The club have said in the past they never received any warnings about Bennell, contrary to what their former managing director, Hamilton Smith, has alleged, and it is important to keep in mind that Gradi has not been accused of any criminal activity, whatever you or I might think about the failures that have led one senior detective on the case to question whether the entrance to Gresty Road should be painted \u201cTardis blue\u201d. Tardis blue? \u201cYou walk through the door and you\u2019re in another world.\u201dAfter two years of investigating this story, it is certainly not easy to know how, or when, this ends for Gradi. The BBC reported in February 2017 that he was planning to appeal his suspension but here we are, over 18 months on, and he is still in the same position \u2013 often seen walking round Crewe, or doing his supermarket shopping, in his club tracksuit but excluded from the sport that has shaped his life.All that can really be said is there are more questions than answers and that, if it has not happened already, Sheldon should speak to Gill Palin as a matter of priority. Palin was once the longest-serving club secretary in the Football League and has been described as \u201cthe font of all knowledge\u201d at Crewe. The inquiry has been told she distrusted Bennell so much she would not let her own son train with him and frequently expressed misgivings about the way the coach surrounded himself with young boys. When a complaint was allegedly made about Bennell, her reaction is said to have been: \u201cWell, surprise me.\u201dWe would know more, perhaps, if Crewe had been decent enough to go through with their own independent investigation rather than reneging on that promise because, they claimed, there was no need to duplicate the police inquiries. That was always a deception. It was the police\u2019s job to look for criminality, nothing else, whereas it should hardly need explaining to any right-minded person that Crewe had a responsibility to investigate everything else. The other clubs implicated in this scandal have spent two years doing precisely that. Crewe, on the other hand, appear to have taken the stance that it is better to be criticised for inaction than finding out what truly happened and having to deal with the potential fallout from what might be uncovered.The statement Crewe released on this subject in March also neglected to mention that Paul McCann, Bennell\u2019s assistant, was awaiting trial after being charged with six counts of indecently assaulting a boy, from 1987 to 1990. McCann was subsequently found not guilty by a jury last month at Chester crown court. Yet the trial also heard more startling details about the practices at Crewe, including the revelation that somebody with dressing-room access was taking pictures of boys getting changed or coming out of the showers.Gradi has been called Mr Crewe in the past because of his long association and influence at a club that size. But how can he say the club did not have concerns about Bennell when Ken Barnes, then Manchester City\u2019s chief scout, went on record in the 1997  documentary  to say that Bowler\u2019s predecessor, the now\u2011deceased Norman Rowlinson, rang him for advice because Crewe \u201chad one or two reports of him mucking about with kids\u201d? Does Gradi recall another incident that has been officially recorded, namely of him finding Bennell with an academy player on his knee at Crewe\u2019s training ground and allegedly doing nothing about it? And if Bennell was notorious enough to be banned from attending matches in the Manchester Youth Sunday Football League, even being forcibly removed from one fixture, why were the alarm bells not ringing 35 miles south in Crewe?Perhaps the answers will come one day. Maybe we will get a different version of , the 2000 book that depicts Crewe\u2019s manager of the time as worthy of comparisons with Sir Matt Busby, Bill Shankly and Sir Alex Ferguson, but in 198 pages airbrushes Bennell out of the story. And maybe there will be a day when the relevant people at Crewe reach out to the players who were raped and molested, hundreds of times in some cases, rather than treating them like a damned inconvenience. It would be reassuring to think all these things were just a matter of time. Two years down the line, however, and knowing what we do, I might be kidding myself to think it is ever going to happen."},

During the election, Comey spoke openly about the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. The Trump-Russia probe was kept secret.Eight days after Comey was fired, deputy attorney general as special counsel. Eighteen months later, the inquiry has led to indictments against 32 individuals and three Russian entities on charges ranging from computer hacking to obstruction of justice.Despite nearly daily false attacks from the president and his allies, the entire team has just kept its head downTrump\u2019s former campaign chair  and former national security adviser  both pleaded guilty to criminal charges and pledged to co-operate.

Federal investigations may go on for three or four years before charges are brought against a few defendants. Also despite nearly daily false attacks from the president and his allies, the entire team has just kept its head down and done their work.\u201dOne charging three Russian companies and 13 Russians goes into amazing detail about the companies, which had budgets of more than $1.2m a month and hundreds of staff creating fake content aimed at stirring up American voters. Another charges 12 members of the Russian military with hacking the Democrats and the Clinton campaign. The individuals are alleged to have created the site DC Leaks and created the , supposed to be a lone Romanian hacker who shared data with WikiLeaks.\u201cIt is really extraordinary, detailed evidence of the way the Russian government hacked the American election,\u201d Milgram said. \u201cWhat is still outstanding is are any Americans charged in connection with that, will Roger Stone be charged, will Mueller write a report on the president, what about Donald Trump Jr?\u201cHigh-level questions remain \u2013 how close did this come to the campaign? Were they involved in the coordinated release of the hacked emails of Podesta? What about the president\u2019s efforts to fire Comey to allegedly obstruct justice?\u201dLittle is known about the inner workings of Mueller\u2019s investigation, which has been operating out of an office in south-west Washington, not far from the National Mall.A grand jury has been convened, meeting at the DC federal court on Pennsylvania Avenue, midway between the White House and Capitol Hill. People appear either voluntarily or under subpoena and are questioned without their lawyer. The jury can weigh evidence and say whether charges should be brought. a British PR man for the Russian Agalarov family, fixed up the Trump Tower meeting with a promise of .\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it,\u201d Trump Jr wrote, before bringing in his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort. He had been promised \u201cvery high-level and sensitive information\u201d as part of Russian support for Trump.You have no lawyers, you\u2019re on your own, so that\u2019s pretty terrifyingGoldstone met Mueller\u2019s team voluntarily. He told the Guardian he was taken in an unmarked car for six or seven hours of interviews in February this year.\u201cIt was a basic room,\u201d he said, \u201ca long table. I sat on one side and they sat on the other side with my lawyers sat next to me. There was something very methodical and logical about the approach to questions.\u201cThere were about six people in total, a couple of FBI people and a couple of people from, I suppose, the Mueller team. Over the course of the day they asked me a series of questions about my email, the Trump Tower meeting and about my relationship with my clients, the Agalarovs.\u201cA lot of friends have asked me did you meet ? I\u2019ve said even if he came in to change the lightbulb or adjust the air-conditioning I\u2019d probably be horrified by the idea that he was there, considering I hadn\u2019t heard he had been in anybody else\u2019s. So I was thankful of the fact I didn\u2019t see Bob Mueller.\u201dOn 9 March, Goldstone voluntarily appeared before the grand jury. He said there were 22 or 23 people in tiered seating.\u201cSimilar sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference there, you have no lawyers, you\u2019re on your own, so that\u2019s pretty terrifying. Terrifying even if you know and believe you have nothing to fear.\u201dAll eyes are on Manafort. Due to be sentenced on charges including bank and tax fraud on 8 February,.Mueller\u2019s team asked for a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s former partner and a key witness against him. Earlier this month they also asked for a delay before updating a judge about Manafort\u2019s co-operationOn Monday, they will submit a report.Observers assume that means an indictment is imminent, against someone. If he is not co-operating fully, Manafort could be sentenced more harshly.Milgram said: \u201cNow the question you and I can\u2019t answer is what does  have \u2026 is he co-operating against the president, is he co-operating against Donald Jr \u2013 and only Mueller knows that right now.\u201dMilgram suspects Mueller was aware the attorney general Jeff Sessions was likely to be removed after the midterm elections. Acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker is already under pressure to keep his hands off the investigation.\u201cI suspect there are a lot of cases already put into the grand jury, some of those could have been voted out and put under seal,\u201d Milgram said. \u201cI think Mueller will have done as much work as possible and have gotten as far as he can prior to the midterms, understanding there was a risk to the integrity of the investigation.\u201dShe thought the investigation might have about six months left, although if Trump refuses a face-to-face meeting, Mueller could seek a subpoena to put him before the grand jury. That could be fought all the way to the supreme court.There is a precedent, US v Nixon, when the justices ruled that the president must deliver subpoenaed materials to a district court.

The Australian captain\u2019s comparative advantage across her celebrated career to date has been control, be it at the crease or behind the mic, underpinned by her peerless powers of concentration. Yet here she was, instinctively giving herself over to the moment, completely and entirely.And why wouldn\u2019t she? Sure, Lanning has been part of many successful Australian teams and is in the middle of a career that will most than likely end up the most productive in the history of the women\u2019s game. But this was a triumph that stretched well beyond putting together a couple of clinical weeks of tournament cricket. That is why it was, she acknowledges, the best moment of her cricket life.\u201cI have to say yes,\u201d she agreed when asked if this topped all else. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most satisfying win I\u2019ve been involved in, especially after the last couple of years. The last couple of World Cup exits for us hurt our team a lot.\u201dAs a reference point,  semi-final loss in last year\u2019s World Cup has been a permanent feature of the conversation around how this side is so vastly improved, above the shoulders most of all. \u201cWe spoke about that as a group and not hiding away from that fact,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe biggest thing has been that we\u2019ve been able to learn and really grow.\u201dBack then, Lanning was batting with one arm all-but falling off, her right shoulder so badly injured that it required surgery that kept her out of last summer entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s had a massive impact on the way I look at the game,\u201d she said of that enforced layoff. \u201cThat timeout for me was extremely difficult; harder than I thought it was going to be.\u201dA major benefit of making a conscious decision to foster a dressing room where aggressive cricket is supported without exception means the days of depending on the skipper alone are over. \u201cNow with our batting lineup that we\u2019ve got I can play a lot more freely,\u201d she explained. \u201cI can just go out there and play rather than feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of responsibility. Over the last year or so we\u2019re not relying on one or two players anymore, and I think that probably found us out a little bit in World Cups.\u201dThe best example of this is Alyssa Healy, the world-beating opener who added the player of the series trophy to four best-on-ground awards from the group stage. \u201cShe\u2019s put in a lot of hard work over the last year or so to get herself into a really good shape and really good spot mentally,\u201d Lanning said. \u201cThe biggest thing was I just saw a smile on her face all the time and that\u2019s what we speak about as a group. She led the charge.\u201dThis win was also a validation of bold selection, namely Georgia Wareham. At age 19 and barely one Women\u2019s Big Bash League season under her belt, the 19-year-old from Koroit in south-west Victoria was given the nod ahead of supremely talented Amanda Wellington. In the final, two wickets and a vital run out made her as valuable as any Australian.Speaking of the WBBL, it is where all roads lead back. A deeper pool of talent is one obvious flow-on effect (look no further than player of the final Gardner, who made her name slaying attacks in the competition) but the fact that it is televised means that newcomers have already been exposed to higher levels of scrutiny and pressure.\u201cTo have those young players step up in such a big final just shows how good they can be and really how calm and composed they are under pressure,\u201d Lanning said of the semi-professional showcase of the best talent in the world, soon into season four. \u201cCricket Australia has supported us wonderfully well over the last five years not just the last bit.\u201dTaking a step back, there\u2019s was an understanding that at the end of a year from hell for Australian cricket, that they had a chance in this World T20 to tell a very different story from sandpaper and cultural reviews and the rest. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about that as a group making sure that we\u2019re carrying ourselves really well,\u201d Lanning said. \u201cThere was a lot of people watching back home and hopefully we\u2019ve been able to make them proud.\u201d Without a doubt, they have."},
{"title": "Australia sink England to claim title", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/25/australia-sink-england-to-claim-womens-world-t20-title", "content": "Two years ago, in the World Twenty20 semi-final in Delhi, England suffered a humiliation at the hands of Australia: a six-run loss, courtesy of a collapse that saw them lose seven wickets for 60 runs. In the interim they have changed their captain, blooded new players and won a World Cup.Even so there was a sense of deja vu today as they subsided from 30-1 to 105 all out, the equation this time nine wickets lost for 75 runs. Once again, it was the old enemy Australia who were their nemesis, storming to their fourth World T20 title by eight wickets.For Australia it was their young leg-spinner Georgia Wareham who unexpectedly stole the show in her first ever outing against England, finishing with 2-11, a catch and a direct hit run-out to her name.\u201cIt\u2019s unreal - it hasn\u2019t sunk in just yet,\u201d Wareham said. \u201cGetting the opportunity on the world stage has been enormous for me, and done lots for my cricket. It\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u201dAshleigh Gardner (33*) and Meg Lanning (28*) then shared a 62-run partnership, Lanning stroking the winning single through the off-side after Gardner punished two huge sixes over Kirstie Gordon\u2019s head to ensure the victory came in style, with 29 balls to spare.Wareham\u2019s big contributions had come at opposite ends of the England innings. It was her run out of Amy Jones with a direct hit from midwicket that started the rot, the star of England\u2019s semi-final short of her ground by 2 metres, leaving her side 30-2 at the end of the powerplay. Eight overs later Wareham demolished the defences of the late-middle order, seeing off Lauren Winfield and Sophia Dunkley with successive deliveries. The Winfield wicket required an astute DRS review, the original on-field decision overturned after the ball tracker showed it would be hitting middle stump.Though Knight safely played out Wareham\u2019s hat-trick ball, the damage had already been done, the England captain\u2019s sparky 25 unable to successfully prop up the middle order. Wareham finally had her number in the 18th over, snaffling a good catch at mid-off to give fellow spinner Gardner (3-22) her third wicket of the day. By that time it was clear that England had fallen a fair way short of a par total.On another day in another final 4,000 miles away, Anya Shrubsole had made sure an under-par total was enough: not this time. Player of the Tournament Alyssa Healy got Australia\u2019s chase going early by punishing Shrubsole for three boundaries in her first over of the day: the bowler\u2019s frustration was clear.Healy eventually added just 22 runs to her tournament tally, bowled by Sophie Ecclestone in the fifth over, and opening partner Beth Mooney also fell cheaply, caught behind when on 14. Even at 44-2, though, Australia seemed largely in control of the situation: Gardner and Lanning did the rest.Earlier, it had been Australia who blinked first, their fielding going awry in the opening overs as usually reliable players let boundaries through their legs and dropped crucial catches. England\u2019s top scorer Danni Wyatt should have gone early, Rachael Haynes spilling a difficult chance at point in the second over of the day.Four balls later Healy herself made a rare error, putting down a flying high catch behind the stumps, giving Wyatt yet another life. It meant that Ellyse Perry had to wait a little longer for her 100th T20 wicket: when it finally came, it did so in trademark fashion, a yorker that trapped Nat Sciver LBW.Wyatt, though, ploughed on, finally coming to the party in this World Twenty20 after a run of low scores. She took 11 off Sophie Molineux\u2019s first over, dancing down the track to send the ball back over the left-armer\u2019s head and forcing an early bowling change from Lanning.Dropped on 11, 12 and 34, Australia took four attempts to get rid of her: she was eventually deceived 7 runs short of her half-century by a flighted delivery from Gardner, finally finding a safe pair of hands in Meg Lanning at cover. Had she batted out the innings England might have salvaged a decent total, but then Wyatt has always been a live by the sword, die by the sword kind of a player.Their under-par showing in the final completes what has been a difficult World Twenty20 with the bat for England, only Amy Jones finishing in the top ten tournament run-scorers. For Australia, meanwhile, the challenge was always to live up to pre-tournament expectations which put them as clear favourites: today\u2019s clinical victory shows they have done just that."},

No doubt they have tried to scrub it out, along with almost everything else that happened in that tournament, but the shadows of the letters are still there along either side of the pitch, a stubborn reminder of how quickly things can fall apart when the heavy pressure comes down. The next tournament is exactly 300 days away. England have come on this autumn, but they look a way short of being ready for the next one just yet.They have the makings, though. You can see where Eddie Jones wants them to go. He has built what must be one of the biggest, roughest, toughest squads England have ever had. No one is going to beat them in a scrap. Certainly not Australia, who were not outplayed so much as overpowered.The tone was set early on, when the Australia prop Scott Sio ran slap bang into Brad Shields and Sam Underhill and got buffeted back like a beachball in a stiff breeze. But after that the first half fell flat. Jones said it was similar to , when they wasted the momentum they had made with an early try.\u201cWe got seduced by the game, and thought it was going to come easy,\u201d Jones explained. It did not. In fact, they were lucky to have so much as a share of the lead at half-time. Owen Farrell could easily have conceded a penalty try when he hit Izack Rodda with a tackle that looked a lot like a shoulder-charge. That is the second time this autumn that . Sooner or later, he will come up against a referee who does not cut him so much slack, and it will cost him and the team. The Australians certainly made their feelings about it pretty clear to the English players and the referee, Jaco Peyper.That might have been their mistake. Because this is not an England team you want to pick a fight with. Not when they are in this mood. Kyle Sinckler always plays like he is angry, but he laid waste to the Wallabies like they had just insulted his mother. When he picked a fight with Adam Coleman, the referee\u2019s mic caught him shouting out: \u201cYou\u2019re all fucking snitches anyway.\u201d Sinckler, a human cannonball, has been one of the standout players of the autumn, and he capped it with a superb match here. He dominated the scrum, and was a wild tearaway in the loose, where he bust holes in the gainline every time he touched the ball.Sinckler was man of the match. It might have been Joe Cokanasiga on the wing. Jones made a point of saying that Cokanasiga was \u201cstill in training pants\u201d. He wants to make sure he keeps his feet on the ground, because this was the sort of performance people get carried away with. There was a moment when Dane Haylett-Petty tried to tackle him, front on, and it seemed like Cokanasiga did not even notice him trying to do it. Haylett-Petty hit him low, in the midriff, and the Bath player seemed just about as bothered by it as a brick wall might be by a rubber ball. He did not even flinch.Haylett-Petty, wearing the same sort of bemused look people used to shoot at Jonah Lomu, was left kneeling on all fours while Cokanasiga sprinted away to score. He almost got another soon after when he caught the ball on the halfway line, slipped one tackler, stepped another, and outsprinted a third. This time Haylett-Petty did not even try to tackle him, but just threw himself in front of him as if he had decided he finally wanted to end it all. This speed bump slowed Cokanasiga just enough for Michael Hooper to arrive and tackle him from behind.In among all this, of course, the usual suspects were at work. Maro Itoje was crashing around and Courtney Lawes smashing around. At times it did not look like a team of Englishmen, but a herd of them. After 70 minutes of this Australia were in bits. And then Jones was able to bring on Nathan Hughes and .\u201cWe played a real English way in the second half,\u201d Jones said, with obvious relish, after it was all over, \u201cwith traditional English strengths: a strong scrum, a lineout maul, and a good defence.\u201d Jones has always said that he wants to build a team that plays in what he says is an \u201cEnglish\u201d style: strong, powerful and intimidating. He spoke about it in his very first press conference in 2016. Two years later, he has done that much. Their play was not all that pretty, witty or smart, but it worked against Australia. The question is whether it will be enough to beat everyone else next year."},
{"title": "What progressives need to defeat Trump: populism and religion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/24/religion-populism-progressives-trump", "content": "eligion and populism have become dirty words in progressive circles, but despite common assumptions, their combination could serve as a resource for the sort of democratic renewal many societies need.There is plenty of evidence to support the view that religion and populism are bad enough in themselves and even worse when combined. The so-called \u201cChristian-Democracy\u201d of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary, widespread support of  by white evangelicals in the United States, the Hindu nationalism of Modi, and the Islamo-Kemalism of Erdo\u011fan are all examples that seem to prove the point. Perhaps as a result, most journalistic and academic work on populism focuses on nationalistic, often anti-democratic strains that conflate the people of God with a Volk or nation imagined in homogenously ethnic or racial terms.As true as this all is, there is no inherent relationship between religion and anti-democratic forms of populism. In fact, historically, it was the interaction of religion and democratic populism that generated some of the most vital moments of democratic change in the modern era. And there\u2019s reason to believe they could do so again today.In early modern Britain, the Diggers and Levellers combined populist and religious elements to advocate for the end of private property and a restoration of Eden when the earth was a \u201ccommon treasury\u201d. Two centuries later, during the industrial revolution, the Chartists and later the early Labour movement combined popular piety with a commitment to God-given human dignity and fellowship to fight against capitalist exploitation. As did the populist movement in the US of the 1870-90s, which laid the foundation for the reforms of the progressive era.The American populists mixed the language of Methodist camp meetings and Baptist revivals to generate a powerful rhetoric with which to challenge the over-concentration of \u201cmoney power\u201d. \u201cThe spirit of avarice is devouring the great heart of this nation,\u201d the Republican congressman from Alabama Milford Howard declared in 1895, lamenting that his contemporaries had lost \u201call fear of God and love for their Fellow-men\u201d.In the late 1960s, this blend of Christian morality and capitalist critique came to characterize Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s leadership of the civil rights movement. King, too, showed that religion and populism could be joined in the pursuit of democratic ends \u2013 especially in the Poor People\u2019s Campaign he helped launch, which sought to bring working class whites and blacks together to agitate for greater economic justice.Decades later, the \u201cthird wave\u201d of democratic revolutions in the late 1980s and early 1990s were religious and populist revolutions. Solidarity in Poland, which overthrew communism, combined Roman Catholicism and populist rhetoric to achieve its aims. As did the \u201cPeople Power\u201d revolution that overthrew the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines. An important element of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the United Democratic Front, also combined religious and democratic populism.Rather than identifying the people of God with the nation, these kinds of \u201cprophetic populism\u201d identify the people with the oppressed from any nation. Exemplifying this today is the Argentinian , a key influence on Pope Francis. Following the t, Francis distinguishes his position from both the clerical and authoritarian right and the revolutionary, Marxist left, to emphasize God\u2019s special concern for the least, the lost and the last.It\u2019s a populism that, in Francis\u2019s words \u201cincludes all peoples and individuals in their full dignity, enjoying as brothers and sisters the marvel of creation\u201d. Other contemporary examples of this kind of prophetic populism include the Moral Mondays movement and revived Poor People\u2019s Campaign, led by Rev William Barber II in the US, and the Mass Action for Peace led by Christian and Muslim women in Liberia.Religiously and democratically, these movements are polar opposites to the sort of nationalistic populism embodied by Trump. Theologically speaking, ideologies like Trumpism are idolatrous: they sacralize an earthly thing \u2013 the nation-state \u2013 and ultimately end up legitimizing the sacrifice of humans, nature and the integrity of faith itself to a worldly project of political salvation. Trump is elevated to a Christ-figure who will redeem the \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201creal\u201d people to the exclusion of all others. In prophetic populism, by contrast, the people are seen as a force that can break the bonds of domination so that all may flourish, especially the weakest and marginalized. The people become a beacon of democracy for all peoples.The history of prophetic populism shows that the union of religion and populism doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to either rule by clerics or the assertion of one faith over all others. Instead, the marriage of popular piety and democratic populism can defend plurality, and help end the concentration of power in the hands of the plutocratic, technocratic, or bureaucratic few. At a time of growing inequality, when differences between religious communities and progressive elites seem to preempt democratic solidarity, a politics of the common good that neither disdains religious voices nor demonizes those without religious commitments could be a truly radical force.Luke Bretherton is professor of theological ethics and Sr fellow of the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University.

I have not been anyone\u2019s bridesmaid. I don\u2019t get called when there is a crisis. The boyfriend of my oldest \u2013 and one of my closest \u2013 friends, died suddenly last spring, just before they were due to move in together. It has been utterly devastating. He was the best man she had been with for a long time, if not ever, and it happened barely a year into their relationship.To start with, I used to see her every couple of weeks and text her nearly every day. This continued for a while, although I wasn\u2019t there for some big moments because I didn\u2019t know what questions to ask or what I could do besides being a listening ear. But since telling her I would be moving in with my own boyfriend, our communication has dropped off. I was dreading telling her because she\u2019d been upset about another friend\u2019s engagement. I miss her so much, but understand the developments in my own life might remind her of what she has lost and make things worse. She is getting bereavement counselling and seeing other friends. I\u2019m worried that because I am quite a closed-off person I will lose a wonderful friend. Is this a case of \u201cIf you love them, let them go\u201d? Should I embrace the selfish feelings I am having and get on with my life?Yes and no. But mostly no! I\u2019m not sure who precipitated the dwindling communication between you, but it definitely shouldn\u2019t continue in this vein. Death is one of a small number of big events in life that we are badly equipped to deal with. Although inevitable, it\u2019s something we dread confronting and imagine that by blocking our ears and humming loudly it will go away. Your girlfriend has had a terrible shock and is dealing with feelings and issues I daresay she never imagined and has no experience in addressing. That\u2019s exactly the moment when friendship is at its most valuable.She needs time and the kindness of friends and family to carry her thoughYou\u2019re making the common mistake of thinking that because you have no wisdom to impart you have nothing to offer. In a world loud with noise, sometimes the most valuable contribution is that listening ear. There\u2019s no advice you can give or salient experience you can recount that will make your friend magically recover. She needs time and the kindness of friends and family to carry her though this mourning period. Her sense of loss may be exacerbated when she watches those around her enjoy experiences she was looking forward to, but it doesn\u2019t mean that maintaining distance is the way to protect her from pain. Little by little she will emerge back into a world that has continued to spin, where people have fallen in love, babies have been born and lovers discarded. The brutal truth is that life can, must and will go on \u2013 and keeping a low profile won\u2019t solve anything.How you share your experiences with her is important. You appear to presume that moving in with your boyfriend is a prize to be coveted and her greatest loss in her bereavement. A reality check on that score might help prevent you from gloating in her presence. Shacking up together is a lifestyle choice and no guarantee of a happily-ever-after. I\u2019m guessing you are both young and so it\u2019s hard to understand that moving in with a lover isn\u2019t the beginning of adult life, or a seal on your romantic existence, but just one of many experiences you\u2019ll accrue along the way. You say it\u2019s worse as they had only recently met, but I suspect that will make it easier. When someone has been your companion through a vast tract of your life their absence can loom ever larger as time passes. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll mourn him less now, but soon their short period together will recede from her immediate memory and, bit by bit, dwindle into the distance.So, back to you. You don\u2019t need to have an \u201cintense friendship\u201d in order to display an interest in the lives of others and this is the perfect opportunity to try opening up. It would be a dreadfully dull world if we all had the same skills, responses and ways of dealing with the difficulties of existence. If we were all brilliantly supportive, functional and wise, great listeners, intuitive, understanding and able to clear pristine paths through tremendously tangled emotional terrain, we\u2019d cause a crush of concern every time a friend had a dilemma.You appear to have a good understanding of where your strengths lie, which is a healthy position to be in. You\u2019re worried about what to say, when all that is required is listening. I doubt your girlfriend is looking for a magic remedy or expecting you to accompany her to the nearest nunnery. What she might enjoy is a chance to be together without focusing either on her loss or your upcoming \u201cgain\u201d of a live-in boyfriend.If life plays out in the way it has a habit of doing, it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019re looking to her for advice and a listening ear. So prise open your clam-like exterior, show her patience, commitment and empathy, and hope she does likewise when the day inevitably comes that you, too, need a shoulder to cry on. "},

The case involves a woman who is suing doctors because they failed to tell her about her father\u2019s fatal hereditary disease before she had her own child.The woman discovered \u2013 after giving birth \u2013 that her father carried the gene for Huntington\u2019s disease, a degenerative, incurable brain condition. Later she found out she had inherited the gene and that her own daughter, now eight, has a 50% chance of having it.The woman \u2013 who cannot be named for legal reasons \u2013 says she would have had an abortion had she known about her father\u2019s condition, and is suing the doctors who failed to tell her about the risks she and her child faced. It is the first case in English law to deal with a relative\u2019s claim over issues of genetic responsibility.\u201cThis could really change the way we do medicine, because it is about the duty that doctors have to share genetic test results with relatives and whether the duty exists in law,\u201d said Anna Middleton, head of society and ethics research at the Wellcome Genome Campus in Cambridge.Experts say that as more is discovered about the genetic components of medical conditions, including cancer and dementia, doctors will come under increasing pressure to consider not only their patients\u2019 needs but also those of relatives who may share affected genes. The case also raises questions over how much effort clinicians need to put into tracing relatives, and whether they will be sued if their attempts do not go far enough.In effect, lawyers say the definition of a patient is facing change. In future, a patient may be not just the person who provided a genetic sample, but may be defined as also those affected by that genetic sample.\u201cThe outcome is potentially very important,\u201d said a spokesman for Fieldfisher, the London law firm representing the woman. \u201cShould clinicians be legally obliged to consider the interests of anyone they are reasonably aware of who could be affected by genetic information \u2013 or is the protection afforded by current professional guidance enough?\u201dThe woman\u2019s father shot and killed his wife in 2007 and was convicted of manslaughter. Two years later, doctors at St George\u2019s Hospital in south London found he had Huntington\u2019s disease and asked him to tell his daughter about his condition and her risk of developing it. But he refused to do so because he thought she might abort the child she was carrying. The doctors accepted his decision.In April 2010 the woman gave birth to a daughter. Four months later, she learned her father had Huntington\u2019s disease. She was subsequently diagnosed as also having the disease. She has had to cope with the impact of the disease, and the knowledge that her daughter has a 50% chance of succumbing to it.The woman decided to sue St George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust, who she believed should have told her that she was at risk. Her lawyers claim the trust\u2019s doctors had a duty of care to share the father\u2019s diagnosis with her, even against his wishes. However, when the case went to the high court, concern was raised that allowing it to proceed could undermine the doctor-patient relationship, while doctors might also be overly burdened by having to assess whether or not to make disclosures to patients\u2019 relatives. The woman\u2019s claim was struck out.However, the decision was overturned by the court of appeal last year. It accepted that doctors might face extra pressure in considering whether to inform third parties about a person\u2019s diagnosis, but said it was not necessarily in the public interest that clinicians be protected from that. This month, the case of Patient ABC versus St George\u2019s Healthcare Trust was set for trial in November next year.However, the very fact that the court of appeal has decided this issue might be enshrined in law indicates that some changes in medical practice are now inevitable.This is emphasised by geneticist Anneke Lucassen and bioethicist Roy Gilbar, who state in the  \u201cAs genetics enters mainstream medical practice, knowing when it might be appropriate to alert relatives about heritable risks becomes an issue for medical practice in general.\u201d \u201dIn fact, in some circumstances doctors do sometimes share information with patients\u2019 relatives at present.But Middleton said: \u201cEnshrining that in law actually gives doctors more protection, but how much effort should a clinician make in chasing up relatives? And those relatives might be unhappy to be tracked down and given unwelcome information \u2013 for example, that they possess a gene that predisposes them to breast cancer. You cannot take back that information once you have given it.\u201dHuntington\u2019s disease is a fatal neurological disease first identified by US physician George Huntington in 1872. The late US folk singer Woody Guthrie was among those who have had the condition.It is usually caused by a mutant gene inherited from a parent, although in a small number of cases the mutation appears to arise spontaneously. Symptoms usually start between 30 and 50 years of age, although they can begin much earlier or later, and include stumbling and clumsiness, depression, involuntary jerking of the limbs and mood swings.There is no cure and it is usually fatal 15 to 20 years after it appears.  are able to provide some treatments for its symptoms."}
